<h3>Purpose of Study</h2>
<br/>
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study that aims to investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as reliable evaluators for tasks requiring expert knowledge in dietetics. We are particularly interested in how the evaluations conducted by registered dietitians compare to those performed by LLMs. Your expertise as a registered dietitian will provide valuable insights into the accuracy and reliability of these models in performing tasks related to nutrition and dietetics.</p>

<br/>

<h3>If you agree to participate:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You will be presented with dietitian-related questions and will review two different LLM-generated responses for each question. You will vote on which output answers the question better. After each review you will provide a 1-2 sentence explanation for your choice. <b>We estimate that this will take approximately 1 hour of your time.</b></li>
    <li><b>You will be compensated $75 upon completion of this survey.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, if more information is needed, you may be contacted to clarify or expand on your evaluations after the study.</p>

<br/>

<h3>Risks/Benefits/Confidentiality of Data</h3>
<br/>
<p>There are no known risks associated with this study. While there may not be direct benefits to you, your participation will contribute to our understanding of LLM-driven evaluations in dietetics, potentially leading to improved models and applications in the future.</p>
<p>The potential risks in confidentiality are minimal and no greater than those experienced in everyday life. If there is identifying information disclosed in your responses, there may be a small risk of potential loss of confidentiality. However, we take steps to minimize that risk by anonymizing all collected data and securely storing it in a password-protected Google Drive folder accessible only to the research team. You may choose to skip any questions you prefer not to answer.</p>

<br/>
