,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response A does a better job because it addresses eating smaller more frequent meals as well as limiting sugary drinks as these are both important components with managing blood sguars. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I appreciate that B notes that the meal plan may need to be changed and should always monitor BS levels. I also appreciate them specifically discussing spreading carbs out throughout the day.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B mentions meal timing, portions, etc as important factors in managing type 2 DM which is very important - not just what you eat. This was less evidence in Answer A. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it recommends choosing complex CHOs, spreading them out throughout the day, recommends incorporating protein & healthy fats for helping to stabilize blood sugars, & minimizing consumption of processed and fried foods which can contribute to inflammation and insulin resistance. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I feel that option B has better terminology for a general audience. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"For similar reason as above. I believe it reflects more of a dietitian's standpoint on DM. Focusing on the balance, timing, and consistency rather than listing foods to incorporate and avoid. B also seems easier for a lay person to understand. It's structured in a way that is easy to read and the explanations flow nicely with the information presented. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think even if another dietitian were explaining briefly in an initial dx of DM,  it is important to recommend a patient follow up with a registered dietitian because even if someone is motivated, change can't happen without consistency. If they don't know how to apply the information you give, it will not be used. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is more consistent with T2DM recommendations specifically.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More detailed structure
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think the specific advice in response B fits better with what I would tell someone. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"both responses provide appropriate recommendations, however, response A gives more detail as to why this affects the diabetes specifically. it is important for the individual to have an understanding as to why these are necessary for their goals"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"A utilizes the glycemic index, this is not generally used anymore as a tool."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like that this focuses on standardized meal plan specifically for that person in the last paragraph of response B
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Goes beyond goal of just BG control. Also focuses on weight management and overall health which are crucial for T2DM management
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think A still meets this one as well ober option B. It addresses not just food choices but the frequency as well. Additionally, it also encourages talking to your medical professional about the plan as that is important to individualize the plan. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both give accurate information. B slightly gives more.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,While I would say they are both accurate. I felt response B was more comprehensive. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, for the same reason as above. There is not a one size fits all meal plan for T2DM, so an RD would be able to work with this client to plan an optimal diet to manage their diabetes. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It talks about using an RD to create a personalized plan. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Both provide information to answer the prompt. Though while A lists the information needed, B feels more explanatory and more well-rounded."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think response B talked about carbohydrates, protein, and fat effect an individual with DM and to follow up with an RD. The only thing I wish response B would've included was the part of avoiding sugary beverages in response A. Hydration is important in any individual so in this case it would be important to focus on DM and what it can mean for a patient who has to urinate frequently. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Because they are asking for guidance on planning meals, response B offers suggestions without giving specific numbers and encourages them to reach out to a dietitian to get tailored recommendations. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Gives more information
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I like the specific consideration with detailed information on managing glucose. They are both accurate, but I think the recommendations are more comprehensive in response A. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Although both contain similar information, response A actually explains why these recommendations are made for diabetes specifically while response B is more just general health. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Asks the participant to consult an RD
 for guidance"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,See above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Did a better job explaining meal timing, portion control, and hydration in addition to tips on carbs/protein intakes"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think B does a better job at providing specifics around recommendations and examples of foods to choose and avoid. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think the flow of B is better and the recommendations are better.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response A was too generic - it didn't really give any foods to eat or not to eat. Response B was much better as it listed high sodium foods, high potassium foods so it provides useful and practical guidance for an individual. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is more clear, more specific, provides examples, and recommends regular consultations with a nephrologist and a renal dietitian. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This includes guidelines for each nutrient of concern. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I appreciate the explanations. While we as RDs might know this information already, I find B hits the major concerns while explaining and providing examples."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I like option A because response B provides more detail and information, option A is a great summary of what people need to know about but a dietitian needs to be present for both to clarify patient questions and concerns. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B provides more information in a well-rounded way and leads to further planning.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Lays the information out better paragraph by paragraph
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B provides good detail and examples when talking about specific nutrients that need to be managed with kidney failure. I also like the emphasis on high-quality proteins since processed proteins can have added sodium and phosphorus. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B just gives more direct information with more detail as to the type of diet that is recommended with kidney disease. It goes through step by step of what nutrients are necessary to monitor with kidney disease, while also providing examples of ways to limit these nutrients. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"provides more specific details for maintaining kidney function
"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"There are more specifics in the second paragraph pertaining to sodium and fruits and vegetables. The first one seems informative, but vague, especially the last paragraph."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response A doesn't give much practical information for someone new to CKD to follow. Doesn't explain what foods have Na+, K+, or phos which is typically confusing for people"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think the level of detail and examples that response B provides helps to make it clearer and easier to understand. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both made sense but B gave much better and useful information
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B provided information that a patient/client could take home that day and start acting on while response A was not helpful. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it breaks up each aspect of an optimal diet to manage CKD, and gives clear examples for each. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B breaks down each area of concern.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Both are clear and understandable. But to a lay person, being told they need to limit potassium could be confusing. Where is potassium found? Then being prompted to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables could also pose problems, as those foods tend to be the best sources of potassium. Or at least the most commonly known."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Both articles are okay but since the response B separates protein, sodium, potassium/phosphorus, and fluid intake makes for an easier read. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Not only does it provide what to moderate, but some sources as well."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Spends a bit more time and laid out by paragraph
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think A is simpler and shorter. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B just gives further details and examples of the foods to monitor/how to decrease these nutrients. Response A just gives general information that does not really provide much help. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"explains importance of controlling protein intake, limiting NA intake, high K, and high Phos  to maintain kidney health.
Explains high, and low K foods, and foods high in phos
Importance of hydration, and to see a nephrologist"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Choice B is more specific
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Talks though nutrients one at a time and gives dietary explanations of each. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B does hit on all of the components that are important to consider with CKD. I like that it emphasized the importance of coming up with a customized plan at the end of it since not necessarily each component or recommendation will be the same for every person. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gave better advice particularly on types of f/v to consume and water limits based on CKD level.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"While response B is more helpful b/c it lists foods to avoid and to consume based on Na, K, and protein - the level of CKD is really the factor that needs identified. The prompt should really be provide guidance for someone with CKD stage 2 or stage 3 b/c each level comes with different nutrients recommendations and so forth. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it specifically delves into protein, sodium, potassium, & phosphorus, and gives clear and specific examples of each. It also recommends regular consultations with a nephrologist and a renal dietitian. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives specific guidelines like the sodium limit. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I believe B is a great example of dietary recommendations given by RDs for CKD. The writing and organization appeared to prioritize in a specific order: Protein, sodium, electrolytes, and then fluids. Which from a clinical RD position, we tend to provide general educations. And since we won't be able to follow a patient after they leave the hospital, we tend to cover the routine basics that I felt were well demonstrated in B. I felt the prioritization of the organization touched on those big keys points."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think option A is a more consistent response as a dietitian because it is short and then patients can ask their own questions based what they are confused on especially if it a new dx. Certain concerns may be more/less important to different individuals. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I feel like including specific nutrient recommendations should not be done on a general basis, those numbers should be given once pt's labs come back and it is known what they should limit to"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Gives more details
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Has better detail and fits closer to guidelines. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B discusses the importance of using lean sources of protein, however, while also limiting the amount of protein the individual is consuming, while response A makes no mention of protein. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"explains importance of controlling protein intake, limiting NA intake, high K, and high Phos  to maintain kidney health.
Explains high, and low K foods, and foods high in phos
Importance of hydration, and to see a nephrologist
Explains the importance of seeing an RD or Neph for help managing CKD"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Again, more specifics in the second option. Doing this for a long time I know that people like lists or menus."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"gives specifics of Na+ restrictions, which is true for patients with all stages of CKD. Encourages meeting with a nephrologist and a renal dietitian to determine dietary goals for other nutrients. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B," I think B is an overall better response as it does answer the question but provides more details about the overall implication of weight loss as whole and the other aspects that are important to consider and identifying that it is not a ""quick fix"".  I also like that it addresses the desire to overcompensate and that this can be detrimental to the goal. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like that B mentioned that it should not be used as a quick fix and noted that weight loss involves a full process of multiple lifestyle factors.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I feel the explanation is more fluid and organized in response A. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I prefer response B because it answers the question better and better portrays the nuances of intermittent fasting. I like that it starts off with a recommendation to consult with a healthcare provider and to proceed with caution (a registered dietitian would also never recommend to consult a nutritionist lol). Lastly, I like that it states ""It is also important to listen to your body and adjust your fasting schedule based on how you feel"" and discusses the importance of exercise & staying hydrated. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This talks about individual needs and discusses exercise. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I appreciate the caution that B addresses. It also provides more for the patient to use to gauge how effective their fasting is.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Talking about what you eat during the day very important is crucial for individuals to be successful with the mindset of weight loss. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B discusses intermittent fasting without giving recommendations as well as hitting hard on the lifestyle changes that must accompany weight loss.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Like that it give 2 examples of fasting
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think they both provide accurate information, but I like response B emphasizing that it is not a quick fix"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I like how response A discusses the negative sides of intermittent fasting and what to actually look for. People may not realize that these negative actions they are experiencing is actually do to intermittent fasting not being an appropriate weight loss method for themselves. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"talks about the importance of exercise and that wt loss is a complex process that takes time, not a quick fix that is a combo of diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B gives a better explanation of not overcompensating for calorie intake, which is really important."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,more clear explanation between risks and benefits of the diet
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think some of the claims that response A makes are not well studied and not entirely agreed upon among medical professionals. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think they are both factually similar, explaining the main point of this diet, main concerns and potential positives."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think it's important to include the side effects of intermittent fasting. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A provides more factual information about intermittent fasting, such as ""intermittent fasting may improve metabolism by promoting fat burning and regulating insulin levels."" However, I do feel response B answers the question about losing weight more quickly better. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This appears more science-based and realistic. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B breaks down fasting for the reader a bit more, while placing heavy emphasis on what to look out for when fasting (i.e. symptoms, hurdles, etc.)"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I am not aware of any studies confirming findings of intermediate fasting just talking about how this ""diet"" will not automatically cause weight loss is important. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Both give factual information, but B seems easier to understand. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Some of the explanations
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This response is more detailed 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Although response B gives more information on the different types of intermittent fasting, response A provides better overall information about what the diet is, why it's beneficial, and the negative affects seen with this method. All of this is important with the decision in starting intermittent fasting "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,gives 2 type of fasting
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B gives ratios for time frames for fasting and supports that thereâ€™s no quick fix.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response B seems to focus more on what intermittent fasting is, which is not the question posed. Response A focuses more clearly on the risks/benefits in regard to weight management as asked"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think B probably better fits what a dietitian would recommend and agree with. Dietitians generally look at the whole picture and think to options that are most sustainable for patients. While there are claims that IF can help improve insulin resistance, we can do that with healthy foods as well and would opt for that in terms of long-term benefits. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I appreciate that response B notes some situations where this would not be ideal or where it would need to be flexible and also notes that it is not a quick fix. I also disagree with A where it say you would not need to have a 'strict diet' because you can still overconsume in a short time frame if you are not choosing the right meal options.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"This one does a better job of recognizing the benefits, mechanism of action and negative consequences than response B which seems to be more one-sided. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I feel that response B better meets the accepted standards of a registered dietitian in communication and application of knowledge, as it begins by recommending to consult a healthcare provider, and ends by looking at the whole picture (listening to your body, importance of exercise, hydration, etc.) and stating ""Ultimately, weight loss is a complex process that requires a balanced approach combining diet, exercise, and lifestyle factors."""
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"It includes the overall picture like food choices, exercise, and tailoring the diet to your needs. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I believe that B provides all the information a patient might need to make an educated decision, especially when it comes to listening to the body. Which all the dietitians I know, always prioritize that when it comes to educations."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think it is important to explain that no diets are a ""quick fix"" and in order to loose weight having 2 sides of fresh with a cheese burger once a day while ""intermittent fasting"" but not ideal for weight loss. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I just really don't like the fact that response A encourages the person to reach out to a nutritionist. Anyone can be a nutritionist and may not provide accurate advice. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Gives more supporting info
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It provides detailed and accurate information.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B discusses how weight loss is more than just the timing of eating, but also the importance of lifestyle, diet, and exercise. People often believe the diet itself is the answer, when it is actually the overall picture. Response B does a better job discussing that, and that is something that is always discussed among dietitians "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Stresses the importance of including exercise and staying hydrated
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Definitely response B because I think as dietitians we try to encourage mindful thinking, and I think this answer leans more towards that."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I dislike the phrasing "" intermittent fasting may improve metabolism by promoting fat burning"" in response A. If the person enters ketosis as a result of fasting, this is not an ""improved"" state of metabolism, it is just a different state of metabolism. A RD would also encourage hydration, exercise, and encourage a healthful lifestyle"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response A is a better overall response as it just addresses the concern of fruit and carbohydrate in general with regards to diabetes. Response B encourages fruit maybe more than I would recommend. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It is more tailored and explained the fruit specific question better.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Provides more explanation of natural sugar versus added sugar - explaining the difference. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is better overall because it discusses how not all sugars are created equal, glycemic index, and that incorporating fruit can even help manage blood sugar levels. It also ends with ""It's essential to speak with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to create a balanced meal plan that fits your specific needs and conditions."""
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I appreciate that this explains why fruits are not bad and how some have less of an impact on blood sugar levels. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I believe B touched more on why fruit can be a better source of carbohydrates, as well as explained the other benefits from eating fruit. However, I did enjoy the section of A on exercise more than the section from B. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Responce B was wishy washy. I read it not sure if it answered the question. In the first article gives manageable goals such as move more, pick low glycemic index fruits, and even better the sentence of focusing on overall health vs just fruits. A lot of my patients go down rabbit holes instead of seeing the bigger picture of a healthy diabetic lifestyle. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response B seems too wordy and full of medical terminology that may be difficult to understand
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like its explanations better
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They are both good responses that provide detail emphasizing the importance of the added benefits to fruit
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"this individual was wondering about fruit specifically, and although ultimately the overall picture does need to be considered, with this specific question it was more appropriate to explain why fruit is still good with diabetes. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This response was more detailed and succinct
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response he gives a better explanation as to the difference between the sugar found in fruits and concentrated sweets, and itâ€™s effect on blood sugar"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Liked that it talked about the fiber content in fruit as well as just the sugar. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response A is generally more basic and is not as scientific so would be easier to understand and follow. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Both are close, B uses some more specific terms that I would imagine someone with T2DM would know like glycemic index, but are harder concepts."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Simpler - doesn't go into glycemic index and is just more straight forward. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it explains why the sugar in whole fruit is different from processed sugar and also explains more how it impacts blood sugar (""The fiber in fruits slows down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, preventing abrupt spikes in blood glucose levels""). Response A feels more confusing for an average individual, stating ""it is important to be mindful of your sugar intake, but that doesn't mean you have to completely avoid all fruits"" makes it sound like you should be worried about fruit sugar. It also states ""Eating a balanced diet that includes a variety of healthy foods, monitoring portion sizes, and keeping track of your carbohydrate intake can all help to better manage your diabetes and overall health"" but it doesn't explain how to do these things, leaving clients confused. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response B uses complex words like glycemic index, sedentary, etc. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A felt more at the level most people are when it comes to their health. It was very short, sweet, and to the point. Which most people tend to want in their answers. I'll be honest, the main deterrent for B was the use of the word sedentary. I know it was in the prompt, but most people wouldn't use that term when describing themselves."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Responce B was too much detail in my opinion. It conveyed the same information but the last line to speak to a dietitian to answer the question... not sure I feel like the first response had a more direct and simple answer. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A could easily be understood by those with less medical literacy. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,More basic
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think they are both fairly equal in their ease of understanding. I just chose A instead of B because B uses the term glycemic index which  may or may not be understood by the average person. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response A just states to eat the low sugar fruits, while response B explains the benefits of these lower glycemic fruits. Providing an explanation helps significantly with comprehension "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,the information was explained in easy to understand terms.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response be as a better answer because it gives your patient a why behind why theyâ€™re doing it so they have the skills to be more compliant long-term
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Focuses more on just the topic of fruit impacting BG levels. Reads easily. Response A assumes the reader knows what fruits are lower in sugar
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B probably does a better job answering the exact question but is not as thorough and does not look at the whole picture that is important to do when it comes to carbohydrate and diabetes. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think that B focused on the question about the fruit more where A gave general diabetic/ lifestyle advice. I would think the patient would be more open to statement B because it answered the question without giving any additional unsolicited advice.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I prefer response B b/c it's more educational and provides specifics on the benefits of fiber on blood sugar. For both responses - the prompt didn't ask about exercise so while it's important for DM - it's not on track for the prompt if you have a limited character prompt - I would rather see more specifics on balancing eating fruits with protein or fat to delay glucose absorption. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because the client is concerned about sugar from fruit impacting her type 2 diabetes, and response B does a better job at explaining why she shouldn't be as worried about fruit sugars. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This starts with a description of the client and addressed their question in a brief way. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B felt more personalized because it actually addressed the concerns first and foremost. While not dwelling on other factors of DM, like A did. It's good to have well-rounded answers, but that is not what the patient was asking for. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Even though response B started about with the person Age and gender, in general it is important to understand the importance of moderation. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A discusses each aspect of the question and gives helpful tips without sounding judgmental. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like better how it explained it.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response be is a bit more individualized and has good suggestions. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"this individual was wondering about fruits, and response B provides greater detail as to why the fruits are still important in a diabetes diet while also being mindful of the amount consumed. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"The response opens with the pts personal information, letting you know that the information is tailored to them"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,See above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A included encouraged portion control and examples of how incorporating even small amounts of exercise can be beneficial. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response A is better overall at addressing the pros and cons of artificial sweeteners and honey. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think B is more clear for an average reader and does a good job comparing the two and giving pro and con of each. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,This was more balanced to the advantages and disadvantages of both options. Response B seemed very positive towards honey while Response A mentioned the fructose and lack of vitamins/minerals which is more truth than touting honey benefits. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A provides the information clearly and lets the client decide what they prefer based on the facts. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Provides pros and cons of each and encourages the client to work with a nutrition professional. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Again both are very similar responses. A just seems a bit more informative, and I'm inclined to prefer more information. It was still an easy to digest article. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response A was more direct talking about honey for someone who was wondering if they for example should use honey instead of sugar in their tea or if the person was dx with DM and asking about artificial sweeteners. I thought response A was more accurate because they are targeted towards individuals with DM or weight management. There needs to be more research done. As a dietitian you need to remain unbiased. So currently sweeteners are considered safe but research is saying there could be some negative effects. This is what I explain to patients currently. I say right now it is considered safe within moderation. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B touches on the good and bad of each and leaves it open for personalization to the specific individual
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Gives more reasons that artificial sweeteners can be harmful
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is more detailed when analyzing the sweeteners and honey. Neither response mentions the potential of insulin resistance and glycemic response that may happen with  sucralose and saccharin. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A overall gives better information that allows the reader to make a more informed decision. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,B wrote that sugar can help regulate blood sugar levels. Some may misunderstand that statement.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,The way the wording flows is easier to understand. I feel like the response be is more all over the place.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Is more clear and concise about how it gives both the positives and negatives about both. Does a great job emphasizing what is best for you depends on your health goals 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I do think response A provides more detail and looks at and explains the overall big picture a bit better. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A gives slightly more information although I am not familiar with the studies noted so I am not sure if I would agree with mentioning them if they were not from suitable sources, but assuming they are, it does give more information. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Covers both advantages and disadvantages of both options better. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A provides more information to back up its response, and ultimately lays out the information for the client to decide. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like that this provides positive and negatives of both to help the client decide which is best for their needs. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A goes much further into details on both honey and artificial sweeteners.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B was better at being direct and answering the question based on hopefully research. But again do not love either option. I think option B was more direct and cited research. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It covers almost everything needed to know about each sweetener source. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,See above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A has more detail, which makes it more comprehensive. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"There is not really a right answer for this question because it really just depends on the individuals goals/preferences. Response A does a better job providing the information in a way that is thorough and feels unbiased, allowing the reader the chance to make the decision that best works for them. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A gives pros and cons of honey and artificial sweeteners but explains in more detail the pros and cons than article B
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,It just explains it better in an easy to read manner
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Gives more details of risks/benefits
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think response A does a better job of promoting the overall balance of using either of these options to sweeten foods. However, I would also never choose to promote honey as any source of vitamins/minerals just because it's such a small amount and should be used sparingly in general. I think it is important that it pointed out considering ""individual health goals""."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think both would be acceptable with the caveat I mentioned in 2nd question of assuming the studies mentioned were legitimate. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think most RDs are going to give a balanced answer. I think both responses need to also include that the real goal would be to eliminate or reduce both added sugars (honey) and artificial sugars and to use fruits as a source of sweetness as much as possible. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A, because it is our job to present the current research & knowledge to our clients & let them decide what is best for them based on this knowledge. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"This encourages the client to know the risks/benefits of both, consider their needs, and encourages working with a nutrition professional. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I appreciated how A addressed the health concerns but also that there are regulations. Every now and then I'll stumble across someone who is anti-Artificial sweetener, and it's all because of that rat, aspartame, cancer study."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This is hard I thought response A did a better job on artificial sweeteners but response B did a better job with honey because I am pretty sure honey or any type of sugar can spike blood sugar it doesn't matter the type.  So I chose response B but I am not a large fan of either response. I chose option B because I think it is important to talk about moderation in honey since I do not know the background of the patient we are speaking to. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Most of these situations are not a one-size-fits all answer. B explains that and encourages the consultation of an RD.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Like how it mentions, ""altered gut bacteria"""
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think B fits closer with what I would say and seems more cautionary
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A discusses the pros/cons in an unbiased way. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,B makes the statement that honey can help regulate blood sugars and that could  be confusing to some
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"People want clear, concise information"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"well communicated, fact based, and reminds that goals of health are person to person"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is more thorough and provides more detail about the overall concerns of some carbohydrate foods while including that our bodies do like and need some carbohydrate. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I do not like the opening paragraph of A. It makes it sound as if there is a true 50/50 debate in nutrition professionals when this is not the case on blanket idea of 'carbs are bad'. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,More accurate. Easier to follow. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I'd say response B is overall better due to its specificity and explanations. As an example, response B includes more detail as to why excess consumption of simple carbs can be detrimental (""can lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, potentially increasing the risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases if consumed in excess"") whereas response A is more generalized (""can cause spikes in blood sugar levels and contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess"")."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This gives more detail on the benefit and purpose of carbohydrates. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"With oncology patients, I get a lot of ""sugar causes cancer"" folks. And it honestly is the most frustrating thing, B addresses exactly what I would tell those patients. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think response B provided more detail and it is important to connect with people that carbohydrates provide energy to the body. Especially since keto diet is a thing, people get confused also important that it goes over what foods contain CHO. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B covers all the bases and keeps in mind that all foods fit
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,more thorough
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like that it starts with validating the importance of carbohydrates rather than making it sound like its debatable whether they are overall good. Then it goes into more detail about the different types of carbs. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"The sentence ""In essence, carbohydrates themselves are not inherently harmful, but the source and quantity significantly influence their impact on health"" is what makes the overall better response. No food is inherently bad for you, it's all about the type and quantity eaten. Response B does a good job explaining the different types of carbs and the importance of this nutrient in our diet. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This response has a very positive explanation about carbs
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The way the wording in response B flows is just easier to follow
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More specific and information is more helpful. Response A felt kind of vague. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B does a better job providing the truth about carbohydrate but also addressing some of the harmful components of it as well. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The facts in both make sense and are valid I just disagree with some of the phrasing around carbs in statement one. Most populations will need carbs and both mention the healthier/'better' options and why but I disagree with last statement of response A that impact of carbs will vary on preference. I think this can be damaging and prevent people from even wanting to eat a 'good' carb. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"This statement in response B is not true - ""potentially increasing the risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases if consumed in excess."" Refined carbohydrates alone do not increase the risk necessarily so the statement is misleading. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I'd say they are both accurate, but response B provides more information to back up its claim. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I feel this is more balanced and includes the benefits. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It goes more into the science behind carbohydrates. Specifically the brain and glucose utilization in exercise. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B talks about balance while option A talked about preference and individual needs. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B discusses types, sources, and possible effects of carbohydrates."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,See above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"They are both accurate, but I feel like B explains it better. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B gives information as to why carbs are important in the diet, however, also discusses that you still need to make the right choices. Carbs are not harmful when the right types and right amounts are consumed, and response B does a better job explaining that. Response A still implies this nutrient is bad for you which is simply not true. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Explains which carbs are not healthy but its the source and quantity that can be unhealthy
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More specific information about carbohydrates and their contribution to both healthy bodies and comorbid
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More specifics on the health benefits of carbs of risks of excess refined carbs
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B was much more detailed. It put the emphasis on maintaining overall balance of carbohydrate intake while still choose complex carbohydrates of simple carbohydrates. I like that it provided the details about why blood sugar spikes can be harmful and the diseases this can lead to.  
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B explains what a carb is at its core first, in a neutral way. Both mention that not all carbs are equal and impact that both types can have on the body. I appreciate that B says carbs are not 'inherently harmful' which I agree with. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B does give more information and is more thorough. It would be the better choice if the statement about increasing the risk was more accurate/reworded. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B covers more detail as discussed above, so does a better job of backing up its argument that carbohydrates are not inherently harmful to health. It starts with ""Carbohydrates are a fundamental source of energy for the human body, particularly for the brain and muscles during physical activity"" and ends with ""In essence, carbohydrates themselves are not inherently harmful, ..."" and discusses the nuances of the types of carbohydrates and their health implications. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B talks about the role of carbs in energy and digestion. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B is once again, more in-depth with the science and reasoning. It puts it into a way that people can understand in the context of the question."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response A talks about simple compared to complex CHO however response B includes this and mentions if you have more simple carbohydrates or do not monitor your fat intake this can lead to CVD. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B goes more in depth without going off on a tangent. Response A never indicated which carbohydrate one should focus on.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,See above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Like I mentioned, I like that it validates it and then goes into more overall detail. It discusses what carbohydrates are before going into more detail. I think the details are better in response B"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B discusses the different types of carbs, unlike response A which only discusses simple carbs. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"explains healthy carbs, which carbs need to be limited, but also that all carbs can fit into a healthy diet"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response be because it comes back to mindful eating, which is an important message to reiterate"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Gave good examples of complex and refined carbs and their benefits/risks.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B will better meet the patient's caloric needs. I do not think response A will do that with the foods suggested. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think the question is a little unclear because she says manage weight but not if she has a desire to lose/ gain or manage it by sustaining. I think B gives more culturally appropriate suggestions that writer might be more inclined to follow assuming they meet calorie goals. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More tailored to the Filipino cuisine by focusing more on specific ingredients and meals tailored to that preference. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is clearer & incorporates many more aspects of Filipino cuisine. It also starts with an introductory sentence, and states ""for breakfast, consider..."" and ""for lunch, you might enjoy..."" indicating that these are simply recommendations that can be modified, rather than a strict meal plan. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This included more Filipino dishes to fit his wishes. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B provided a much more in-depth menu for the patient's preference for Filipino food. It also highlighted more with the patient's allergen.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think it is important both sound very similar but the wording between consider in response B compared to start your day with in response A can make an impact on a patient. Sometimes they will think that's the patients only option. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Honestly, these two responses both seem very good. The use of specific examples and references to Filipino cuisine would be understood by the person asking the question as they likely know some of these dishes. Response A uses easier to understand language."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More culture-specific responses
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B incorporates Filipino cuisine better (as far as I am aware) and has specific recipes to avoid peanuts. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,response A provides more reason as to why they are recommending the foods
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"This response gives more detail for the recipes, and explains what the protein is in each dish. B offers a recipe name but not what type of protein is in the dish
 A offers 2 meals that are naturally peanut free, and one that can be made without peanuts.
"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Actually response be addresses the peanut allergy as well as giving some examples so this would probably be the better response
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response A was not nearly as specific to Filipino cuisine 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B will better meet the calorie goal of the patient. Response B also provides specific alternatives to foods containing peanut that the patient can choose instead. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I don't think A really mentioned any Filipino dishes or spices. Soy sauce and garlic are very broad and used throughout most of Asia where things like calamansi are very Filipino specific.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They both are accurate but felt response B was more tailored and fully provided Filipino cuisine requests. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is more specific & incorporates many more aspects of Filipino cuisine.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This took into account the Filipino cuisine and his peanut allergy. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B felt much more in-depth in providing Filipino foods and touching on when allergens might be present. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B combines culture, weight maintenance, vegetarian diet, and eating peanut allergy. Both responses , depending on the portion size may not meet 2,500kcal daily. But response B adds words like generous portion to tell the patient they need a good serving size of rice instead of just saying the food items. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They both seem similar in this aspect. Response B goes more in depth with the desired cuisine requested
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,More concrete examples
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The information in B has detailed information on modifications to the recipes to make them safe. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"eggs are still part of the vegetarian diet, and recommending swapping them out for tofu is inaccurate and does not have to be recommended. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A explains each recipe and what  veg and protein are in each recipe.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,See above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response A appeared to take the person's phrasing of ""manage my weight"" and assumed weight loss. Not many calorically dense foods, the meal plan recommended likely wouldn't meet their caloric needs to maintain weight"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B will better meet the patients specific requests. It will meet the calorie needs as well as help the patient avoid peanuts. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives more ideas for the writer on cuisine she likes and notes more peanut substitution options. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Fully provided more Filipino cuisine in response B (especially lunch/dinner) 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, for the same reason as above. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B did a better job of choosing Filipino food. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Again it addressed all that the patient was asking for. Examples of Filipino food, vegetarian, peanut allergen. In fact, it also made the foods sound very appetizing despite my unfamiliarity with them."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Option B also combines more of the patients culture and desire to maintain their weight to get more calories in their day. For example, response A says to add side of toast compared to response B is more thoughtful and is okay to recommend having rice at breakfast time. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It touches on specific Filipino dishes
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They were both fine
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think the details are better in response B
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"response b provides more filipino dishes which is what this individual was looking for, while keeping the meals meat free, nutrient dense, and filling. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"B gave two recipes that required pt to modify recipes to accommodate for pt's peanut allergy, this can be frustrating and confusing."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Again response, I think gives examples as well as addressing the peanut all"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"included allergens, healthful fats to increase kcal intakes, and specific Filipino cuisine examples"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response is a much more specific and detailed response. It provides specific details about how much protein to get and can be tailored to the individual. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think this is better answer because it notes food/ vitamin pairing which is helpful for less bioavailable options and mentions importance of electrolytes. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is far more detailed - provides protein goals, more specific nutrient deficiencies common for vegans - it's more useable information. However, I would still suggest a RD recommendation. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it is much more specific and touches on many more nutritional elements to look out for while training, such as plant protein, calcium, iron, vitamin D, omega-3s, hydration, & electrolytes. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives much more detail about several nutrients. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B feels like a more elaborate form of A. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It actually answers the question. Response A in my opinion didn't answer the question. It basically went into carbohydrates and then said to talk to a professional to answer the question. Response B which not a lot of people know is that it is very important to plan when being a vegan or vegetarian to make sure you are getting complete protein sources. Option B was by far the better answer. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,It covers important aspects of macronutrients without giving specific numbers. It encourages this person to reach out to a dietitian to get specific numbers to meet their specific needs. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Gives specifics
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B is more exact. It covers the nutrients in more detail, with a focus on protein and iron. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I like the detail, but more importantly I like that it provides a recommendation for the amount of protein to eat. Being told to eat enough protein is difficult to do when you are not told the amount. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Gives precise amount of protein pt needs, and important essential micronutrients and importance opf hydration"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B gives more of an explanation as to why a vegan training for a marathon needs more micro and macro nutrients, and how to get them"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B goes beyond just macronutrients. Also contains micronutrients and hydration. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B provides that information in the answer. It provides the protein goal for someone who is quite active.  It hits on other nutrition concerns such as iron and other vitamins that can be lacking in a vegan diet. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This would give the athlete a more targeted goal for their protein needs and ways to combine foods throughout meal plan.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Provides more detail and more information about overall well balanced by mentioning nutrients specifically and hydration. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it gives the client specific nutrients to be aware of while training for a marathon on a vegan diet, explains why, and provides examples of where to find these nutrients. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B is more well-rounded and detailed. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Personally I adore the fact that it reviewed the different vitamins and minerals and their role in what the patient is doing. The protein goal will also help down the line as the patient progresses.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Long term success B. Because vegans are good at getting carbohydrates in their diet typically. They are unaware that they need to pay attention to their bone health, omega-3, hydration, and the amount of protein they need in a day. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Long-term, someone may not need as much of each nutrient as is listed in response B. Response A has the recommendation of a dietitian who could reassess their needs if they are no longer training for a marathon."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,More specifics are given
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The exactness to detail  provides more opportunity to learn. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,this just gives greater detail as to what this individual needs as it is more than just carbs and protein 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"same as above, give protein rec's, importance of essential micronutrients, hydration"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B gives grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight so this individual could continue to follow through with a healthy email plan
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"More depth to the answer, explained clearly with examples."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think overall B is still the best response here. I like that response A encourages the athlete to contact a dietitian however response B touches on more of the aspects that I would want to address as a dietitian. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I appreciate that A notes to speak with sports RD but I do agree with all the information given in B and if someone was seriously training for a marathon I would imagine they would find the more specific direction helpful.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response A goes into carbohydrate importance and the reality is vegans are by default going to get plenty of carbohydrates. It's a waste of a paragraph. Response B covers the keys to vegan issues- protein, nutrients lacking and then also covers hydration. It's a more well rounded answer. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it provides much more detailed guidelines & touches on many more nutritional elements to look out for while training, such as plant protein, calcium, iron, vitamin D, omega-3s, hydration, & electrolytes. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"This talks about all aspects of sports nutrition, not just protein. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I felt it was very in-depth, educational, and set great goals for the patient."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I am not sure how response A addresses the question besides added foods high in protein that are considered vegan. In response B, it provided a holistic answer including the importance of prep. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,It is important to make recommendations that are specific to each person. Providing calculations on a generic basis could lead to improper nutrient intake.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,The details are better aligned with how dietitians present info.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I feel it is a better response for following the dietary guidelines for vegan athletes. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B answers the individual's question with types of protein but also provides examples of the other nutrients they need with a reason as to why they need these nutrients 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Gives specific protein rec's
importance of including essential micronutrients
importance of hydration"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response be I think covers all the bases of the question
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Protein recommendations in Response B are too high. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is much more thorough and relevant as it does address the concerns surrounding alcohol consumption, fast food intake, and caffeine on performance. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think these are almost the same and written in a similar way but the mention of caffeine and alcohol in B is an added suggestion that I think could be relevant and important for this person.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response A didn't emphasize the benefits of the fats enough - it was an afterthought in response A and really shouldn't be. Response B offered a more well balanced answer. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it is clear & well organized to answer the client's question. It also provides explanations for its recommendations, such as ""Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish like salmon and flaxseeds, can aid in reducing inflammation and improving recovery."""
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I feel like B is more well-rounded, gives specific guidelines, and includes important things like avoiding alcohol. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,This one was harder. Both explain and review example foods for what the patient is looking for. A feels like it encompasses more though. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I believe response B was more accurate not 100% sure if alcohol and coffee directly affect athletic performance. I did however like the end of response B where it talked about fast food ect. effecting athletic performance. So reposes A was more general and then speak to your provider. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It touches on all aspects of the question without being too full of medical language 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Like that it mentions alcohol
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I like the additional detail in response B, including specific examples with the nutrients. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A provides more detail as to why the response is making these recommendations. I don't feel response B articulates enough as to why these recommendations are necessary to help the individual meet their goals. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"explains why proteins are important, why carbs are important, that processed food hinder recovery, and the importance of hydration and talking to an RD"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Again, I think response a gives more of the reasoning and explanation behind the recommendations"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"While Response A reads more smoothly than response B, response B includes more specific examples for the reader to use. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I do think response B is more personalized as it does include more of the aspects that a 25 year old may generally be tempted to fall into such as alcohol, high calorie convenience foods, and fast food"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I would say they are equal. Both mention similar topics and reasons with B giving slightly more suggestions.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I am only choosing response A b/c of the comment about choosing protein at each meal. Response B did not provide any frequency of the important protein nutrient. However, both responses were good on this one. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it more specifically provides nutrition recommendations to improve muscle recovery and performance. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This gives specific dos and donâ€™ts for the young athlete. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A provides a lot of answers about muscle recovery, and gives more details reason as to why it can help the athlete. It felt more like it was establishing goals for the patient. Rather than a ""Do and Don't"" list"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"The first thing I thought of when I read this question was to avoid alcohol. I think it is very important part since typically 25 year old males may consume alcohol and this needs to be discussed. Both responses mentioned protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. However I am not sure where I learned in school is totally accurate. I know great athletes who drink alcohol. I believe it needs to specify the amount. Because coffee should not correlate to athletic performance but it does say limit which is recommended as a healthy lifestyle. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Towards the end it touches on the needs vary from person to person, so it is important to consult with a dietitian. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,more specifics of interest to a 25 y/o
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like that it addresses the nutrients and hydration in more detail. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response B is just a little too general, while response A states to eat carbs to provide energy for workouts and eat protein at each meal after intense workouts. These few specifications make it more clear that the target audience is an athlete, and not just general information "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I like A b/c it explains why the specific nutrients are important for performance or recovery
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response be is more of a fact listing response so I do think response is more Taylor to the patient
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Includes plant-based proteins under the protein section, includes information on caffeine and alcohol which often athletes don't consider, and need for sports drinks (which contain sodium). Response A tells the athlete to limit sodium which is not helpful for an athlete's rehydration"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I do still think B is a better long-term approach and provides more practical/basic information and guidance. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Same answer as above. Both give ideas and explanations that I think are good.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B provides a better explanation of the importance of each macronutrient in performance and recovery which a client can build on this knowledge. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is more applicable long-term, as it provides specific recommendations, gives the reason for the recommendation, and then an example for how to incorporate the recommendation. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives more clear guidelines including all food groups. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A provides more a basis for goals than B did. It seems like it provided more achieve-able goals. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think knowing the difference between a healthy and non-healthy fat is important lifelong. And then at the end giving big picture of you can still live but in general follow a healthy lifestyle is perfect way of talking about sports. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"It covers the different food groups that need to be focused on and then touches on foods that should be ""limited or avoided"" rather than being told to avoid altogether. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They both would work
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B covers more detail on the benefits and detriments to certain foods that would be valuable information for a 25 yr old male athlete. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A just provides more reasoning as to why this recommendations are essential for this individual 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I like A b/c it explains why the specific nutrients are important for performance or recovery
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,See my above answer
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B gives a lot of specific ideas that the reader can implement into their lifestyle. RDs encourage patients to start with just a few changes and build upon them so this gives the more specifics on how to do so vs the more generalize recommendations in response A
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B is more appropriate for someone who is of the college age. It provides a more complete response for addressing the components with foods and fluids. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think these are very similar but I like that B gave snack ideas that can be easy to take on the go.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B gave more examples of specific foods- especially when it comes to snack options. Response A missed snacks and didn't emphasize hydration as much as response B. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A provides more nutrition information to back up its response, such as including details about vitamin C, vitamin A, & omega-3s. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A gives more details about specific foods that are beneficial. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A provides more details. B is very basic and not very descriptive. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think that the second opinion is more realistic for a 20 year old college student to follow. It focuses on overall goals of keeping full, energized, supporting your brain/muscles, and on the go. compared to a more generic response in response A. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It is brief and to the point of what would be helpful and logical for her schedule
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Gives more food examples
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is more comprehensive and shares information about specific nutrients and their impact on academic and social demands. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A goes into more detail about why these foods/nutrients are important for this individual at this stage of life. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A stresses the importance of maintaining bone health.
A is more succinct, gives more details about why the pt should eat certain foods, B is more general."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response it gives more specifics and also the reason behind the advice
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Both responses do well explaining need for food variety, response B includes snack ideas which is helpful. Information was presented in a more practical way"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is better as it provides more general information and does not touch on the specifics of the nutrients it provides and would be better for the general population. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"It is not as detailed as the first with reasons why, but contains more action based info."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response A was too detailed- college kids aren't going to care about the specific vitamins and such in different fruits/veggies. A more generalized approach from Response B is more audience appropriate. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B does read more clearly for an average individual, providing actionable recommendations such as including whole grains, protein-rich foods, fruits & veggies, healthy fats, & staying hydrated with non-sugary beverages. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A has more appropriate details. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B is easier to understand and follow. Especially for a college student who might just be looking for a quick answer and might not care for the elaborate answer.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B helps a college student who has no little time at baseline understand what is important from a nutritional standpoint quickly and conveys the more important information. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Some of the more complex words were removed and provided easier to understand wording
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Talks more in general
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think B was simpler and less detailed. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"This response uses very basic terminology, that most individuals can understand. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,B is too wordy
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response a uses simple communication for most to understand 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Easier to read, more practical application examples given"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like that response B address hydration and importance of avoiding certain sugary drinks and items that we know do not help with focus and stress management. Response B does provide some specific examples but not too many and some more commonly utilized foods that would be accessible to a college age individual. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It gives actual ideas for snacks and drinks.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B made more sense for a college student. They likely need a more basic answer like response B - they may not be able to afford expensive foods such as salmon. They need snack ideas. Both responses missed any emphasis on limiting processed foods or eating out that would be a huge factor in most college students lives. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it provides more actionable and easy to understand recommendations for this individual. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A gives the client more details to create healthier habits. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A addresses all of the patient's needs. Whereas B seems to be very general.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response A gives a generic whole grains are good for you, protein is good, fruits, and vegetables are good. I will agree it is important to mention dairy since your bones develop but knowing the importance of snacking is also very important. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"This response takes into account not only her demanding academic schedule and what the body needs, but also the practicality of food to consume when she is on the go"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Same as above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think this was an appropriate response for  a college student. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Eat paragraph in response A gives information on why these specific nutrients are important, however, then the last sentence explains why these recommendations are important for a 20 year old college student such as discussing bone health, focus, etc. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A  explains what foods sustain energy, and help the pt stay fuller longer. 
A Gives specific vitamins to include and  that antioxidants enhance immune function 
Omega 3' sources help brain function"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B is a little bit better because it gives specifics that are unique to a 20-year-old female in the college setting. At least foods that would be easy to obtain either at a grocery store or in a dorm cafeteria.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,More specific explanations of how the nutrients meet the individuals' various goals
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B provides more options for the individual. While response A is a good response it is just not as detailed and does not provide as many options. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Again, very close but B gives some more reasonings while both give similar meal suggestions."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B gave more ideas and more flexibility within the meals. Response A was more of a 1 day plan. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is better overall, as it provides more accurate information in a clearer and more customizable way. Response A mainly just provides 3 recipe examples, without providing more information for the client to build off of and make their own meal plans. On the other hand, response B gives an overview of what to focus on, and then gives some recipe examples. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Option B was more educational. It did a better job of teaching why each food was chosen and gave practical tips to help the client learn how to make his own decisions and choose healthy foods to lower his cholesterol. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B seems like it addresses a bit more than A does.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"More information in this case is good because most patients want a "" here's what you eat answer"". Response A was a clear eat oats, eat salad, and eat a stir fry and eat popcorn ect. However Response B talks about reading food labels and how nutrition isn't cookie cutter. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B is more inclusive but A touches on more meal recommendations and is simpler
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More details
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like examples and recommendations in response B
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,this response gives both an explanation as to why these foods are important to meet the individuals needs while also providing examples of how to use these foods. People need to know why the examples provided help meet their needs. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"It provides specific foods pt could eat, that can be prepared the night before or purchased already prepped."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I believe response the factors in the patientâ€™s lifestyle, a little bit more and talks directly to that"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,much more thorough and explained more clearly with better details
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I do think option B is more tailored to the individual. It just provides more suggested options for the individual. I do think when giving meal and food ideas, including specifics is very important. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like the mention of bulk prepping and giving some more context to suggestions.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B also mentioned foods to avoid with the hidden sugars and unhealthy fats- that is important to include but likely needs expanded on. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is more factually accurate, as overnight oats with oats, almond milk, and chia seeds contains no dietary cholesterol, not low dietary cholesterol, and saturated fat plays a larger roll in blood cholesterol than dietary cholesterol does. It also targets the client's questions clearly, for example ""Oats are a fantastic choice for breakfast; they can help lower cholesterol and are quick to prepare."""
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B provides more explanation to teach the client how to make healthier choices rather than just giving him a meal plan. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B discusses more of the ways to manage high cholesterol in addition to providing those quick meal ideas for the patient. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Again mentioning food labels is the most important thing to mention. Its more important to teach people how to have a healthy nutritional lifestyle compared to having a strict here is what you should eat at each meal. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It meets the criteria of his question with a little more background information
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More examples
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"They both have good examples, I think response B fits better with the specific needs. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Something that really stood out with this response that makes it even better for this individual is discussing using the precooked, canned foods. The individual said they didn't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, and this is huge with preparing stuff ahead of time. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"B is to general, it lists many great ingredients pt could use for quick easy meals but doesn't give pt any direction to prep the night before

A helps pt visualize prepping the night before"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I believe theyâ€™re both actual, but I believe that bee is a little bit more so"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"gave a larger variety of foods that help improve cholesterol levels. Included lean proteins, healthy fats, and high fiber foods. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think B is still a more acceptable response as well. It gives several ideas and examples that most dietitians likely would agree with. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think they are both similar. I chose B because it explained itself more.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is more well rounded with including foods to eat and foods to avoid (although this part needs expansion). 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it gives the client the tools they need to move forward, as well as some examples to get them started. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B educated the patient rather than just stated facts. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B allows for more application. A provided one example of each meal, whereas B lists options that the patient can play with at home. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Giving clear answers with patients rarely works because if you generalize they will try and do exactly what you say instead of thinking for themselves. They may eat a salad for lunch when they love soup. You can talk to a patient how to get a low sodium low fat soup options. Especially a homemade soup. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B explains more
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More details
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"They both align with recommendations, but I feel like response B is more open in guiding the user to interpret the response. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I just don't feel that response A really gives any education. Just ""eat this"" with no real reason as to why. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B does give more options overall, but if a person doesn't cook and wants fast things, B is too general. People need specific examples."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Again, I think that response be less what needs to be done along with the why and encourages mindfulness and follow up"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,more detailed which information was evidenced based
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I really like that response B provided information about supplements because for several people this tends to be a more common option. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Very close, but I think A is better because it focuses on foods and answers question without too much depth."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A spells out all the omega-3's fully; response A only focuses on food sources which is the original prompt request. Most people can get enough omega-3's through diet so I would avoid response B b/c it jumps into supplemental sources too fast. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B provides more information, such as about how ALA is converted into EPA & DHA in the body, and also discusses omega-3 supplements. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,This focuses on food-based sources of omega 3s. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A covers the sources and health benefits for Omega-3s, but it goes more into the application of these foods."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,This is basically because we should recommend getting omega-3 through food but most of my patients would read this and not know what to take away from that paragraph. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They asked for sources not every aspect of omega-3. B is concise and to the point. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Just appealed to me more
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think the definition in response A is better, but I like that response B included supplements. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I like how response A provides additional options of foods fortified with omega-3s instead of just recommending a supplement, because this helps the individual still consume the other nutrients they would receive from foods. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A explains the importance of Omega-3 FA more clearly and in a more positive way. A makes me feel like it will be very easy to incorporate Omega-3 FA into my daily meal plan.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It is just easier for the average patient to understand.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"More reader friendly, easier to understand examples and explanations"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think response A does a better job of explaining the abbreviations whereas response B does not do that. This may be easier for someone to understand, even if they do not know what those words mean, it provides credibility. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think A gives more actual food options and would be better understood in general population.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A does a better job of explaining omega -3 from fish and omega-3 from plants. However, there is an error - flaxseed oil is a great source of ALA - not a modest source. Response A also talks about how to incorporate these foods into a daily plan which is practical. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B reads more clearly, starting off with fatty fish that contain EPA and DHA, then moving on to plant-based sources for those who don't eat fish & explains how plant-based sources contain ALA, which is converted to EPA and DHA. Lastly, it ends with supplementation as a final resort, mentioning that this should not be used as a replacement for a healthy diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids from whole foods."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"B talks about converting ALA into DHA and EPA, which the average consumer will not understand. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,B might be a bit too complex for the lay person to understand.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think it is easier to understand option B. I try to make my replies and documents at a 6th grade reading level for my patients. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It eliminates the unnecessary physiological aspects of Omega-3
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,See above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It is shorter and more straightforward
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think response A just provides more specific information while response B still keeps the information a little too general. When information is too generalized, sometimes it can cause more confusion than clarity "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A provides animal and vegetarian options for Omega-3 FA, and gives recipe examples"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Spelling out EPA and DHA and giving their definitions. I donâ€™t think is necessary and the reader might get lost in that information and not glean what they need from the message.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response B didn't need to focus on the conversion of ALA into DHA and EPA- this is beyond what the question asked and could be a confusing added information for the reader
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I do not agree with pointing out the fortified options when it comes to dairy or eggs in response A. These generally contribute quite minimal volumes and are not nearly as beneficial as the other options. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think both are good but B gives more science and omega 3 specific information
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response B is just not thorough - it glances over food choices and then jumps to supplements which is not likely what a RD would do. It also has this statement "" ALA is converted into EPA and DHA in the body, although this conversion process is not very efficient."" - This is old school thinking as we now know many factors impact this conversion. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B provides more details & background information in accordance with accepted standards of dietitians. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,This focused on whole food sources. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A provides specific examples of application that a patient could easily try at home.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Dietitians tend to recommend getting your omega- 3 through food instead of oral supplementation. Even though response A is more accurate, sometimes accuracy is great but means nothing if no one can understand what you are trying to convey. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It offers options in a variety of ways to meet the needs of the person asking as well as considering their preferences 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Most dietitians are food first vs supplements
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"They are both accurate, but I think response B is more comprehensive. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A provides information on the types of omega-3s in the diet, while also providing ways to incorporate these foods. This also gives more information on foods that have the omega-3s (including foods fortified with this nutrient), and ultimately, it is always best to get these nutrients from Whole Foods, which response A focuses on. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A does not use ambiguous terms ""The conversion process is not efficient"" From B  
People will not understand what this means, there is no other context."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The information is just easier to read and follow
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,evidenced based examples
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Overall, I like response A better. However, I would not recommend banana in a smoothie for a diabetic and like the smoothie recommendation from response B better. I do think there are more suggestion in response A that are appropriate for the pt other than the smoothie. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think this was easier to read and I appreciate that it mentioned the importance of planning a specific menu with their healthcare team. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,These were really close for me. I don't feel like one is strongly better than the other but option A was missing anything hydration related. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I prefer response A because it mentions the meals should ""include high-fiber foods, lean protein, and healthy fats, while minimizing refined carbs and sugars"" so the client knows how to balance meals outside of the specific recommendations. The smoothie example also includes chia seeds, which will help manage blood sugar levels more than the smoothie example in response B. I do like that response B says to consult a registered dietitian. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A includes more details like including fiber and meal prepping. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Love examples, but I love B's more since they provide more options for a patient to use."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response A went into more detail and know patient asked for a meal plan since response B talked about following up with a dietitian and gave a more general response to the question. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B reads better, covers all aspects of the question and is more factual"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,They are both fine.  This one provided a little more details IMO
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They are both good responses that provide vegetarian appropriate recommendations for handling diabetes mellitus. I like that response B recommends the user seek out healthcare provider or a registered dietitian.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I like how to it explains what is needed in the meal and the reason why it is necessary for blood sugar control. response B just states what is needed, but does not provide the why in enough detail. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B explains in more detail what foods to eat and how to keep blood sugars stable
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"This was a tough one to decide as well. I like them both, but I think is a little bit more tailored to what he is asking for. It gives an explanation of why he needs to have the certain types of foods as well as giving examples of the foods that would fit."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Like the specific goal given "" A balanced meal plan that stabilizes blood sugar levels should include high-fiber foods, lean protein, and healthy fats, while minimizing refined carbs and sugars."" vs response B stating to just include, protein, fat, and carbohydrates. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is better long term as it provides more examples and ideas of incorporating foods. It also provides a few more details about the why behind the recommendations and what this does for blood sugars. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think they are similar in suggestions and information.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response A was missing hydration recommendations. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I'd say response B provides more information to support the individual's long-term goals, as the last paragraph goes into more detail about meal timing, and recommends consulting with an RD, who will work with them meet their goals. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A discusses how some things can be made in advance. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B provides more of a solid base for the patient to utilize and make decisions on in the future.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think the fact the last sentence response B was important to stay hydrated and follow up with a dietitian. Because If you increase fiber you also have the increase water as well. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Focusing on balance and moderation while making it fit into their schedule promotes long term commitment
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,See above response
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,They are both adequate responses that provide good information supporting the goals of the individual
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"this response explains the ""why"" for each of these nutrients. when individuals know exactly why they should be eating this way, they will be more likely to stick to this meal pattern. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B explains what foods to eat and how those foods help control blood sugars, the importance of hydration, and meeting with an RD"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response be indicates that he should get in touch with a registered dietitian for a meal plan which would be long-term and more tailored to his needs.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I really liked that it started out telling them that dietary changes are manageable despite their busy schedule. Gave some specific examples but also some information about nutrients to include so they can go beyond the examples given. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B provides fewer examples for the pt to incorporate and generally fewer details. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,A mentioned more details about specific items and noted portions and pairings in the ending statement.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,No hydration mentioned. No mention of working with a HCP for further guidance which is really necessary with DM with strict food preferences. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I suppose response A is more broad, however they both go into detail in different areas. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This does not discuss his busy schedule and how to prepare foods in advance. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A only really lists examples.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Again do not love either response but response A provides more detail and options but response B also added the importance of hydration. I thought the question was better answered in response A and felt well generalized. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A doesn't really focus on incorporating each food group in a balanced way. It also does not address meal times to accommodate the busy schedule. Also some of the suggested snacks/meals may not work in an on the go setting. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It provides less detail
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B goes into less detail 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"response B does a good job stating what is needed at each meal with examples, while not over explaining. it discusses the ideal eating schedule as well without going into too much detail. with response B, it feels like the individual knows what they need, but also is not being over explained/overly strict of a meal plan like response A may provide."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A does not explain how foods help stabilize blood sugars

A does not encourage hydration or meeting with an RD"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B gives less detail as far as meal and snack ideas. I like both of them, but I feel like thereâ€™s not enough science behind the first one to explain why he needs a variety of foods and he might just get stuck in the rut of those particular things."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Much less specific information regarding nutrients. Focused more on carbohydrates as a group vs talking about fiber and refined carbs. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think B is overall better because it provides an actionable plan for the pt. The patient could look at this and implement it tomorrow. There are specific ideas provided that would make up an entire day for her. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,They are close but A is more thorough in answering all her concerns.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"She asked for meals and response A did not provide that. Response B was much preferred as it gave a few meal options for Breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack. This I find more helpful. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A gives the client a more well-rounded overview of what to look for and which foods to choose, as well as tips for simplifying meal prep. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives much more meal examples versus just listing foods. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A feels a little bit cookie-cutter, very basic. B at first glance was very nice with it's examples. But only provides one example of a meal. A while basic, does provide lots of ideas that the patient can filter through."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response B felt like they were answering each question separately instead of putting things all together and gave a meal plan. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"While response B gave more examples of specific foods to include/consume, response A gives more information related to the patient herself.  "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Seemed simpled but good
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Option A mentioned the nutrients to be cautious of, but included dairy which is high in phosphorus. Option B is more appropriate for the actual renal diet. Both had good recommendations. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,this provides specific recommendations for each of this individuals concerns while response B just gives example meals with no real explanations. protein powder is also not generally recommended with kidney disease making one of the suggestions inappropriate for this individual 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B gives breakfast lunch, dinner options that are all gluten free EXCEPT the soy-sauce for dinner
Asks pt to speak to a dietitian or healthcare provider
Goes into more details about nutrition needs for CKD"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This was a little more difficult because people want the kind of information that is in response because they want to be handed meal plans. The problem with this is that they tend to have a limited perspective because those are the only examples they have and they tend to use them and then get tired of eating it and steer away from the meal plan principles 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"While I thought Response A did better explaining ways to simplify meal prep (batch cooking), examples were contradictory. 1 example: Encouraged low phos choices but then recommended dairy for bone health which is high phos. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A provides more ideas of foods that the patient could include. She would have to put those ideas together to come up with a specific day to day meal plan but may be a better options long term for her. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,They both gave similar information on food options but A mentioned the prep itself.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A does a better general overall explanation of what is needed for bone health- gluten free options, etc but does not really provide any meals as requested. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response B gives a good example of a day's meals, however doesn't give the individual the information to work with outside of those recommendations. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This gives practical suggestions for mealtimes. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"B provides a short-term guide, where as A provides more foods for the patient to choose from and options for tackling easy to prepare meals that the patient asked for. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"It is important to mention things like staying well hydrated for kidney health, however needed a phrase if not on dialysis need to monitor protein intake. But talks about calcium and Vitamin D for bone health. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A allows the patient more flexibility which would allow her to stick with diet modifications. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I like that it suggested a slow cooker
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"It offered a specific diet plan as requested in the question, with individual snack and meal recommendations. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,this response gives actual examples of meals which is what the individual requested 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B offers more details about importance of limiting NA, K, and phos.
Offers more GF options and focuses more on CKD and bone health"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,It gives reasons behind why youâ€™re doing it and not just examples of me
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"not perfect,. but more accurate in examples given"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think B still is more tailored to her as an individual and does give her want she asked for, a dietary plan that could work day to day. She may get tired of the choices recommended but it does provide what she asked for. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think they are close but I like the options mentioned in A regarding batch meal prep and tools the person could use. My only issue is it said to 'drink plenty of water' and that could be misleading if pt is on fluid limitations.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I actually think a combination of these prompts is perfect. Response A is missing the meal suggestions but response B is missing any actual explanation that the client needs to better understand the choices recommended. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A is more thoroughly tailored to the individual because it looks at the whole picture, rather than just an example meal plan. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This includes meal preparation which was one of her concerns. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B felt more tailored to the patient's situation, despite being a bit one-note. As the patient has the idea for a meal, but nothing else to cycle through."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,The A article also talks about gluten free options that also are within patient guidelines. I did like in article B it mentioned why it is important to take the ease or take strain off kidneys. In general saying snack of apple and peanut butter is good but I think it is more important to give tips like hydration instead of one example of a meal plan. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response B provides recommendations without input from patient on what she prefers to comsume.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,See above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,While response A provides a good breakdown of the nutrients it does not caution against one of the foods it recommends - dairy. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"although does not give specific Meal recommendations, this gives better overall thorough information that will better their health with the questions the individual had. it provides examples of foods to make with easy ways to prepare these foods"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B explains why pt's need low NA, K, and phos, and why bone health is important

Also asks pt to check with pcp or dietitian."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,All the reason stated above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,more factual information provided
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is focuses more on the whole picture and provides a longer more sustainable solution for this patient's concerns. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A is easy to understand and focused.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A provides more details- offers foods to eat that fit into the goals. Response B does not. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it starts with an overview of the Mediterranean diet principles & food groups, then goes on to provide specific recommendations for targeting weight loss, then for sarcopenia. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This focuses on both concerns of high protein but also promoting weight loss. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A provides a bit more insight to the Mediterranean diet, as well as the why behind each food group."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response A provided more detail to answer but not in answering the patients question while response B the first two paragraphs were almost filler and didn't really contribute to an action plan for the patient. But overall I think option B was easier to understand and did not recommend something that some dietitians are able to say ( exercise) 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It is worded in an easy to follow way as well as answering all aspects of the question
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,It is a more complete answer and provides various suggetions
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I feel response A is more aligned with the goals regarding sarcopenia and obesity. It includes good information about the mediterranean diet. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"response A starts with explaining why foods In the Mediterranean diet help met the individuals goals, and then goes into detail about which foods to incorporate more of"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The writer answers each question the pt asked  specifically
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I feel like response b better targets each thing that is helpful for both weight management sarcopinia
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Easier to read. More tailored to their mediterranean diet preferences
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B addresses more than just the Mediterranean diet. It includes information about strategies for weight loss as well as exercise.  
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Both give accurate info but A focuses more on their diet interests and preference. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A breaks down the Mediterranean diet more clearly with foods to eat so the person can then go design a meal. Response B while accurate is too broad. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it provides specific recommendations for what foods to incorporate, and then the reason. For example, ""To target sarcopenia, make sure to include plenty of high-quality proteins in your meals such as fish, chicken, legumes, and nuts. These protein sources contain the amino acids necessary for muscle repair and growth."""
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B gives more high protein, pescatarian options. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B addresses sarcopenia in a very straight-forward manner.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Not sure we can recommend exercise training, but I would've added talking to your physical therapist or doctor before looking into resistance training may be a better statement. But yes this is also important information. But response A since it talks about lean protein but goes into fish but also mentioned "" sugar spikes"" the patient did not ask about DM. Even though two paragraphs were fillers in response B I think it did a more accurate representation of information. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This response focuses on the lifestyle changes and dietary changes that would need to be made as well as incorporating the preferences of the person asking. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like that it mentioned weight training
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"They both have accurate information, response A shares information emphasizes the role of protein in muscle maintenance and the roles of healthy fats, whole grains, and portion control in the Med. diet. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"eating an adequate amount of protein, while also doing exercises to increase muscle mass is how one improves sarcopenia, while cutting back portions/incorporating more nutrient dense foods leads to weight loss. response b has this information clearly stated in its response"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"talks about Med diet and antioxidants, importance of adding resistance training to maintain muscle mass. Talks about limiting processed and food high in sugar, and staying hydrated"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response b directly correlates the dietary advice to the individuals concerns and again uses the terminology, mindful"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"both promotes discuss need for protein, food variety, and resistance exercise. I prefer response A because it also includes smaller more frequent balanced meals to prevent overeating and encouraged meeting with an RD"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is more thorough and hits other aspects of what this patient needs beyond just the Mediterranean diet. It hits on exercise which we know is important as well as hitting on some key components for weight loss. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,B seemed a bit generic where A was more tailored to the diet preference of patient.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is more specific and actionable. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it directly addresses all elements of his question, provides rationale for its recommendations, and is easy to understand. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B does a better job of discussing weight loss and more protein options. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A feels like it addresses more of the patient's concerns. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B," I am not sure why response A went into inflammation, energy needs, and sugar spikes. I do not think it answered the patients question. Always important to follow up with a dietitian but I do not think parts of response A were answering the patients question. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It addresses the specific disease states of the person and explains the Mediterranean options well
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They both provide decent info
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think it is more focused on the individual's request providing general and specific advice. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,this response directly explains why the foods in the Mediterranean diet 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This response seems to talk directly to the pt
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,See above
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"answers were evidence based, met the patients asked for goals, and was tailored to their dietary preference of mediterranean diet"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response A is more comprehensive because it hits more on the medical concerns around following a ketogenic diet. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think the science and balance of A is better.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response A is not very accurate as the entire paragraph about being hign in protein is not true. A ketogenic diet is not high in protein - it's moderate in protein. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A provides more information on the potential health implications of following a ketogenic diet long-term. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B discusses possible benefits like treating epilepsy 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Both explain the issue well enough. But I couldn't help but be put off by response B promoting the ketogenic diet for diabetics. I've seen people end up in ketoacidosis from the keto diet and being diabetic. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Definitely response A. Response B is not a healthy way of thinking. It will NOT benefit someone with diabetes. It is very difficult to keep the body in ketosis. Diabetics need to have small amounts of CHO throughout the day to manage their blood glucose levels. I have had to explain this to many patients with DM. It is WAY more important to communicate the dangers of the ketogenic diet. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Most dietitians will not recommend a Keto diet to anyone who is not epileptic. Any weight loss sustained from this diet will not be long term. Response A goes more into why one shouldn't follow this type of diet. However, I do like the correlation between the restrictive behavior and disordered eating patterns. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response B doesn't mention the micronutrition missing from fruits and vegetables.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I like that this one includes the benefits for neurological conditions like epilepsy and goes into pros and cons. I feel like the first response makes it sound primarily bad and I think that the mechanisms and implications need to be discussed more in detail. However, I don't like that response B does not actually say what the keto diet is. I like that the first response first defines it before going into detail. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"It is always best to have both the positive and negative affects of the diets given to individuals. there is never one right answer with nutrition, and if not given the whole picture, a person cannot make the right decision for themselves. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Better organization of the information in B

A touches on topics(kidney disease, mental health issues) that aren't really common side effects for most on a Keto diet

Response B touches on the more common issues that happen with people on the keto diet"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,This response directly answers the question that was asked of long-term effects
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"touches on both positives and negatives of the diet. I don't like the wording at the end of response  A ""individuals should consult healthcare providers for personalized advice before committing to it long-term."" RDs encourage dietary changes that can be kept up long term not just a fad diet"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B is probably easier to for someone without much medical knowledge. It is a more general and basic response. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Both are easy.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is more general and doesn't get into the nitty gritty of vitamin/mineral deficiencies as with response A. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is clear to read and well-organized in its arguments. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The terminology is appropriate. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both are easy to read and follow along to. However B uses more terms that would likely be easier to read.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response B does not convey reliable nutritional information such as "" helps with Alzheimer's"". Really the focus should be on making sure patients suffering with Alzheimer's disease EAT and eat three times daily and with a good amount of protein. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response B uses some big words that could be made simpler. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Just think A hits on more points
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Like I said with the last response, response A defines the keto diet before going into more detail. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B discusses conditions that most people are already aware of and understand the implications of these conditions, which helps them know why this diet is or is not the best choice fro them"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think most people wouldn't understand about the kidney disease or the mental health/seritonin information
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response a directly answers the question and defines it in simple terms with long-term effects are as opposed to response be which list positive and negatives to the keto diet.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Less specific medical terminology that the general public can get lost in. Unfortunately, we are taught to cater education to an elementary school reading levels unless the patient shows you further understanding. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I like response A a bit better as it does provide a more comprehensive response to the long-term implications of following a ketogenic diet. I think response B is good and may hit on more of the idea of considering a whole lifestyle component, but A is more specific and detailed with medical conditions and concerns. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I like that A gives specific examples of when keto may be recommended. I don't love how B makes the pros/cons seem comparable. A ketogenic diet is really a medical diet and should only be used with guidance to balance level of ketosis.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response A is just not accurate. In addition to the high protein aspect not being true, the vitamin/mineral deficiencies noted (C, K, Mg) are also not commonly found in ketogenic therapy. Zn, carnitine and Se are more common deficiencies. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A provides all the information & potential health implications, allowing the individual to decide for themselves whether a ketogenic diet is worth exploring. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This discussed risks and also when it may be of benefit. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"While B focuses on the positive and negative impacts of ketogenic diets, I don't fully agree with it's message. Whereas A reviews all of the concerns and lays them out nicely for a patient to make a sound decision with. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Most people do not know the ketogenic diet can cause nutritional deficiencies, kidney health, and mental health. Not sure where information got changed but it is concerning since avoiding carbohydrates or cutting them out is NOT a solution for controlling DM. It is having consistent CHO and good sources of CHO throughout the day. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Keto would not be a good option for diabetics as they should be consuming a consistent amount of carbs across each meal rather than restricting. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Touches on disordered eating.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like the pros and cons list here better
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"pros and cons always need to be provided to give the best option. although not personally a fan of the veto diet because it's not often done correctly, it can be beneficial for an individual when done correctly. if this is the diet a person wants to follow and will stick to it, it is important to show them both the good and bad that can happen "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It is written in an easy to understand way.  B doesn't go over the readers heads and talk about complicated medical issues.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response to a directly states facts, which I think is a better approach"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"recognizes the positives of why patient may do the diet, emphasizes the negatives, and encourages them to talk to an RD or MD before making any changes to diet, short or long term"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like the specific details of response B. I thought it did a good job of explaining why aspects of this item may be concerning and the effects of that. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I appreciate the more in depth information of response B regarding the fish size.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Provides more details of what nutrients are in the product and why they are beneficial. Although it is missing the vitamin D and selenium that are briefly mentioned in response A. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I would say response B is better overall because it includes more details and explanations rather than generalizations such as ""supports overall health."" However, response A may be better to present to clients who want a more boiled down answer that highlights only what they need to know without including extra details that might make the overall message harder to remember. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like that B gives risks and benefits but ends with deciding your individual needs. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I'm a sucker for more information. It is still digestible in its size. But it just goes over so much more. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response A sounds more coherent and highlighted all of the reasons tuna packets could impact an individual from a nutritional standpoint. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It answers every request in the question.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Like how B is laid out better.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B has a decent analysis of the benefits and risks. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A is concise, to the point, and still gives all the information the individual needs when making a choice"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The first paragraph of A is a little confusing. The first sentence is confusing. Are the heart healthy fats from the tuna or the olive oil?  It is a poorly written sentence.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I believe both responses give clear information about the properties of the tuneup, but be explains the negative effects a little bit better"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Explained nutrient content and health risks/benefits more in depth and more clearly
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is more general and does not provide as much medical jargon and language that may be more difficult to understand.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A covers basics and B gives some more explanation or detail.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Less detail - but easier to comprehend likely for a lower reading threshold. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response B is more specific in regards to nutritional and health details, for example by explaining why we should be concerned about mercury in tuna and stating ""support muscle building, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function"" rather than ""support overall health."" However, response B only mentions omega-3s and protein as health benefits, whereas response A mentions vitamin D and selenium as well. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A doesnâ€™t go in as much detail about the benefits, potential risks, and allergens. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,It just didn't elaborate on the health benefits or health concerns as well as B.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think that the Response B is more detail but Response A is more generalized.  Sometimes though detail doesn't mean bad. Yes you can have an allergy to tuna but that could be for any food, someone could have an allergy to this. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"They are extremely similar, but I feel response B goes just a little more in depth"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Overall less detail
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think response A has a little less detail, it has less information (like species of tuna) than response B"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response B uses a lot of extra words that just get in the way of the point they are trying to make. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A says ""some people"" may be worried. B explains in more detail the risks of eating tuna, and who is at risk, it also mentions potential allergens of the product"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Be is the more generalized response
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"didn't give as much nutrient information
"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"As noted in other responses, B provides more detail and more content regarding potential effects and concerns of incorporating this item. It does a good job of including information about the benefits and potential concerns. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B explains why olive oil is a good fat option, why yellowfin is a particularly tricky fish option (opposed to lower mercury like skipjack or light)."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Offers more specifics about why it's heart healthy - monounsaturated fat. It's gives more details. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B offers more context regarding the nutritional components & health benefits by providing specific nutritional details (""These nutrients support muscle building, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function,"" ""extra virgin olive oil, known for its monounsaturated fats,"" ""antioxidants, which can protect cells from oxidative damage,"" etc.), whereas response A provides the answers without giving much education on the reasoning. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,There is more detail in B along with info regarding allergens. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Very informational, allows the customer to weigh the pros and cons. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"response A says that individuals who are pregnant are ""more sensitive"" to that effect and response B talks about how it is an immune response. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The depth to which it answers the question is just a little more educational
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Mentions more of the micronutrition
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"It goes into more detail on specific nutrients, like omega-3 fatty acids. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"response B discusses the nutrients the food contains and why this is beneficial or not beneficial for the individual, although does so in a very detailed way"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Mentions heart health, cognitive function, antioxidants and mono and unsaturated fats"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response be definitely spells it out a little clearer and gives more information to support
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,more thorough on explaining nutrients to consider and their risks/benefit to health
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B provides more details and explanations as to why it is a good gluten free option. It provides details about some of its other nutritional benefits as well. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think A gets the point across, answers the question, and is easy to read."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,These are pretty similar but I thought response b was easier to understand and reads better. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is somewhat more specific & detailed, & provides more in-depth nutrition information such as ""quinoa is rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, such as magnesium, iron, and B vitamins."""
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is more simplified for the average audience. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They appear to be very similar. Though the word choice and writing of B just caught my eye more.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,The response B contained too much information and restated the same things. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B is easy to understand and follow. It hits on major points without being overwhelming
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Thought it read better
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"This is the more comprehensive response, it includes good advice about the benefits and gluten free nature. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Although response B is more information, Response A answers the question in a more concise way. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,More Succinct
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I feel like it gives more specifics about the benefits of quinoa, and also how to use it"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Does well comparing to other grains, focusing on its benefit in GF diet, and how to include  in cooking. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like that response B provides more detail about the specific nutrients that quinoa provides. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They give similar information but B gives more information.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They are both factual. I like how response B goes into more detail with vitamins/minerals it is rich in. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B provides more information on the nutrition composition of quinoa.  
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,This response is more simple without filler words. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B touches on the protein content as well at the vitamin/mineral/fiber content of quinoa. Which A does not do. More information -> more appreciated.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B goes into vitamins it contains and more about what dishes it can be used in. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B explains more into each aspect of quinoa
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,They were both factual
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I like the focus on micro-nutrients like magnesium, iron, and b vitamins in addition to protein"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B goes into more detail and provides more ways on how to use it in a gluten free diet. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Lists some of the specific vitamins and minerals of Quinoa
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"It speaks to the essential nutrients and getting protein, especially on vegetarian or vegan diets"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both responses are factual. Response B just gives more information. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think that the detail and variety of examples/explanation that response B provides makes it clearer and easier to understand. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A is more concise and easier to understand. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Reads more fluidly. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is more clear for the average person to read & understand. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,B embellished with complicated words. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both are very clear and understandable. B addresses all it needs to and is very easy to read.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Seems more personalized and sometimes it is important to know ALOT of my patients when I go into detail about vitamins and specific nutrition zone out. They care about how does what I am saying apply to them. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I felt like response A jumped around a little
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More detailed
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"They are both easy to understand, the less detail in response A does make it a little more clear"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A has the same information, but is more clear and to the point. There is extra fluff in response B that is informative, but can get in the way of the understanding as to why quinoa is a good option. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Uses les complicated wording that lower literacy patients might not understand
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,See above 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,First paragraph is more difficult to read in response A
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is more specific related to whole grains. It is quite detailed and provides more ideas for including whole grains in the diet. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think A is more thorough. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I feel giving people substitutes is important so by saying eat whole grain bread vs white bread. Advising people (as in response B) to eat these foods - may lead to a calorie excess situation and lead to weight gain which is generally not wanted for most individuals. Giving substitutes is more transferable to home life. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is clearer to read for a client, starting off with a list of whole grains to incorporate more of, then going on to provide meals ideas and substitution recommendations. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both give good examples of whole grains but this has more info on healthy substitutions. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A provided a nice combination of examples, explanation, and scientific reason. I particularly liked offering of ideas with each meal."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think response A was better because the patient did not ask why it was important to eat whole grain they are already motivated to change so they do not need to know why it helps more so as more information on which foods they could eat that contain whole grains. I usually ask what the patient eats before responding so we can talk about specifics but generically, I think response A answers the individuals question better even thought response A is easier to read. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It leaves it open for the patient to incorporate whole grains in a way that fits their meals rather than providing specific whole grain options for specific meals.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I liked its explanations better
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"They are both good, I like the specific examples in response A better. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B provides the same information, but does so in laymen's terms making it much easier to understand. It also provides specific example meals, but just swaps like response A does. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"gives more examples of whole grain options, including ancient grains
explains the importance of reading nutrition facts label 
"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It takes them more positive approach and gives specific examples
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,better examples of how to incorporate whole grains into diet
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A gives more information about the specific benefits of whole grains. It touches on the glycemic index as well as the benefits of whole grains providing more vitamins and minerals. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Neither gives a ton of information but A mentions more benefits.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,The label reading information in response A of looking for whole grain as 1st ingredient is huge and very very important. That alone makes the prompt more factual. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it concludes with a reminder why it's important to include more whole grains in your diet, by stating ""Incorporating more whole grains into your diet can provide numerous health benefits, including improved digestion, increased energy levels, and better weight management."""
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Good info on which grains are whole grains which are refined. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A provided lots of facts in addition to their examples. I liked how it listed the benefits immediately after the food was mentioned. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think it was important and factual that reading food labels about the first ingredient being whole grains is very factual in response A because I have been with patients who purchase honey wheat bread but the first ingredient is corn syrup. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The last paragraph is all about the benefits of whole grains
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Pretty equal
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think they are both accurate, I think like the examples in A. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"This response provides more examples of whole grains, which ultimately is the question being asked. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Offers more whole grain options overall, including ancient grains. Importance of reading nutrition facts label "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response gives much better examples and support those examples with every day useful tips
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"both answers are factual. Response A gives a lot more examples however response B does better at more thoroughly explaining some potential health benefits of more whole grain in diet. The individual didn't ask for why whole grains are beneficial, so Response A is better. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A is more detailed with some of the science behind whole grains whereas B, which is a good response, is more general and focuses less on the details. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Similar but A is slightly better as it notes protein and glycemic index difference and teaches about reading food labels.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B last paragraph provides far more information about the health benefits of whole grains than response A content which doesn't really specify the health benefits; however, the prompt didn't ask about the health benefits. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, for the same reason above. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The practical examples make B a better option. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A provided both educational information about the health benefits, but also how to find whole grains as an ingredient. Allowing for future application."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,response  B at the end listed all of the benefits of adapting whole grains all in the last paragraph response A was very generic and mentioned glycemic index briefly. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response A focuses on the foods themselves rather than the components and health benefits of whole grains.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,They both make good points so I don't feel strongly 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think the context of the benefits with the examples as it is explained in A is great. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"This response has an entire paragraph discussing the health benefits of fiber rich foods that are not mentioned in response A. Response A just says these whole grains can help you reap the benefits of fiber, but doesn't discuss what those benefits are"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"gives more examples of whole grain options, including ancient grains
explains the importance of reading nutrition facts label 
Whole grain pasta has a lower glycemic index
"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Endless ways that following whole-grain diet will benefit the patient such as weight management and increased energy levels
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Gave more information about the health benefits of whole grains. Response A is vary vague with this.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A is much more thorough and detailed as a response. It does a better job of explaining what gluten is, what it does, and then details about why some people need to avoid it. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A gives more information but both are correct.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A provides more details and more specific terminology. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A provides more detailed information on what gluten is, who needs to avoid it, a background on celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergies, including symptoms."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I appreciate that response A described the different types of allergies and intolerances and also included the risk of cross contamination. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Both go into immense detail. While A's explanation of gluten is very informative, B felt more in-depth with the actual conditions."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think the first article does a better job at explaining the only people who need to avoid gluten are individuals with celiac disease OR wheat allergy. The second article ( B) left the door open with gluten sensitivities to avoid all forms of gluten together. I have had multiple patients avoid gluten fully because a doctor said "" maybe you are sensitive to gluten you may need to avoid these food groups."" "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B more accurately answers the question while leaving it open in way that can cover other disease states, reactions and sources."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Like the layout better
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A goes into more detail on what gluten is and it's role in baking. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,this is just more clear and concise for the general public's understanding 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B flows better, is more succinct.
A doesn't explain the importance of choosing GF foods
A uses the work cross-contamination and the correct term is cross-contact when talking about food allergies"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It is more concise
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"More thorough explanation of what gluten is, role in foods, and conditions in which it may need to be avoided. I liked that it also included information about cross contamination. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"The response of A is very thorough, and I think provides more details around the responses of wheat/gluten as an allergen."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think they address it equally.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,They both are similar but response A I prefer. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A delves deeper into the physiological aspects of celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergies, and described each of their differences & symptoms. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,This response gave more detail on each type and discussed cross contamination. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both provide about the same information. Though B discusses the range of severity.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Similar to my last response but article A goes into the seriousness of celiac disease and cross contamination. Also the importance of mentioning anaphylaxis is important. This would be life threatening instead of sometimes general like swelling.  Mentioning the swelling is in the throat is important. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is more thorough when discussing allergens
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,They both are OK
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A goes into more detail about the different medical conditions, including discussing allergens. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Both responses provide accurate information, however, Response A just goes into more detail about the different reactions someone may experience and the reason for that. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B devoted a paragraph to explain each allergen which makes it easier to understand.
stresses sticking with GF foods to avoid a reaction
"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I donâ€™t know if I would say it is More accurate, I think both responses are accurate. I just think a includes a little bit more specific about the actual allergy."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response B doesn't talk about damage to the intestines that can happen with celiac disease
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is very similar to what I would address and provide with patients. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A is slightly more detailed.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Gives more specifics on where gluten can be found. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A, because it is more scientific and provides more detailed information to answer  the question. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"This discussed the types of allergies, where gluten can be found, and discussed avoiding the allergen and cross contamination. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B goes more into the science behind Celiac's where A does not. As well as the reason that some people may choose to go gluten-free and not necessarily have Celiac.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think both articles do a decent job at expressing knowledge and information. However I prefer information presented for certain patient populations. Making it clear that individuals with an allergy is DIFFERENT than those with a sensitively is what I look for when discussing celiac disease. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is more open rather than putting all gluten related issues in the same box.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,They are both fine in this regard.  
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think the added detail helps this explanation. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"the big difference is that response A mentions the need to check the labels for cross-contamination/hidden gluten. Cross contamination often gets forgotten about, and it Is really important for individuals with allergies to know if the foods they are eating are processed in the same factory as their allergen in order to avoid reactions. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"explains importance of choosing GF foods to avoid a reaction.
doesn't use the term anaphylaxis, which people may not understand.
"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response is just a little bit easier for the average patient to digest
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,encouraged adherence to a strict gluten-free diet to manage symptoms and maintain health. Encouraged being aware of risk of cross contamination. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B is just more thorough and complete. I like that response B includes information about the potential reactions that can occur from consuming these foods. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I like that A mentions food labels specifically.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More detailed - example listing dairy more prevalent in children and including range of reactions. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Overall, I like response B better, as it is more clear and relays the information in a more organized way. It also states ""milk"" instead of ""dairy,"" which is more accurate. However, it is missing sesame, and does not advise reading the nutrition labels and communicating allergies with restaurant staff, which is important to include. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B is a much more comprehensive list of foods that may contain each allergen. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B elaborates more on allergens in general and what products might contain an allergen. Off topic, but the paragraph organization of both was a little off. It felt weird to only address 3-4 allergens in one paragraph and then the rest in the other. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think the most important line that needs to be said is to read food labels. Response A gave the individual an option to look at common allergies and is being proactive on how to prevent anaphylaxis. Even thought response B talks about preventing exposure, it doesn't give a solution like knowing how to read the ingredients on a food label.  However response B does stress the importance of knowing about anaphylaxis both say how to treat. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,The second response leaves out sesame which is now part of the top nine allergens. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Goes more in-depth
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B provides more detail 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"response A provides examples of each of the allergens, while also stating the importance of reading the labels/communicating your allergen as it has not provided an all encompassing list. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"explains about severity of food allergen
wheat allergy  info explains that wheat is in gluten containing foods
Except B leaves out sesame"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Although response a directly answers the question, response B outcomes of consuming these foods if individual are allergic to it"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Emphasizes need to look at labels and communicate with other people preparing your food about the allergies. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I am not sure that sesame falls into the category of the other allergens just yet. While it is common, I think the others still hit that top list."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives better examples and explains allergies better.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think they are both factual and I see minimal difference. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A is more factually and thoroughly tailored to the individual, as it does mention sesame, which was declared a top allergen in 2023. It also ends with ""It's important for individuals with food allergies to carefully read food labels and communicate their allergies to restaurant staff to avoid potential allergic reactions,"" which is important information for clients. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B includes more foods to avoid. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B provides more examples of allergens. A actually surprised me by not mentioning some baked goods and processed foods as a part of peanut allergies. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think knowing you can have an allergic reaction is worse than saying you need to look at the ingredients on a food label. If you say awareness and management, this infers to the fact patients need to be aware WHAT they are eating. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is more up-to date.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More details
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I feel response B answers the individual's question better
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"wheat is not the same as gluten as indicated in response B, which can be very misleading and cause an individual to stop eating rye/barley as it contains gluten but not wheat"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A includes sesame
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response is definitely more direct and just list the food, which is what the question asked."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"In 2021, the FDA added a 9th major food allergen to the formerly known ""big 8."" Response B doesn't include sesame. I do wish response A used the word milk when listing the allergen and phrased the milk allergens differently such as ""Milk allergies can be triggered by consuming dairy such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream."""
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think response B is potentially a bit more inaccurate in terms of how it discusses ages that allergens specifically affect. I am not sure that that is entirely true as allergies can affect people of all ages, and many people do not necessarily grow out of them. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B addressed more symptoms.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I like response B better as it's clearer and easier to read. Response A just seems to be run on and gets very monotonous in how it reads. Although I do think response B is missing this line "" It's important for individuals with food allergies to carefully read food labels and communicate their allergies to restaurant staff to avoid potential allergic reactions."" "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A discusses allergens more accurately, as it does mention sesame, which was declared a top allergen in 2023. However, it refers to ""dairy"" rather than ""milk"" which is less accurate. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,The list of foods is more comprehensive. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Reviews them much more thoroughly. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Responce B is more clear with what the 8 allergens are instead of dairy ? I do not believe is one of the 8 allergens. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response B is fairly vague. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,They are both fine overall.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Both have accurate information, I like B's detailed response better"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,it comes down to reading the label because these allergens are not always obvious to the consumer 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A includes the Big 8 allergens plus sesame. and gives more examples of each food allergen
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B I believe is the better response seeing as it does give outcomes as well as examples
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Gives examples and emphasizes need to check label as the examples they gave are not all-encompassing
"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I like response B better however, I do wish it contained more information about the iron fortified cereal that response A provides. I think response B does a better job of including more of the why behind some of the concerns and anxieties that come along with infant feeding. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives specific signs to look for and mentions newer research of early introduction of allergens.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response A is not as accurate and more vague. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is more clear, provides examples of which foods to start with & why, provides an accurate list of common allergens & the signs to look out for, as well as current guidelines to introduce allergens early & in controlled amounts. It also touches on choking hazards and recommends consulting a pediatrician before introducing high-risk allergenic foods. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Overall this gives more up-to-date guidelines and also includes soy as a top allergen. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Be encompasses both guidelines, but also touches on dangers and what to look out for. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think A was more clear what to look for but overall B provided better information overall. Giving more information to a new mom is good. They are more likely to read information for their child and are going to be more interested in specifics. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B has all the information and provides tips and exactly what to look for.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More details
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like the accurate reference to current research and the caution to ensure the foods are soft enough to avoid choking hazards. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"This response provides safety hazards to consider, which although seems obvious, is still important to mention. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"more detailed information about how to start solids
explains what allergic symptoms  to look for in the child
What an appropriate timeline is for introducing foods
explains when to introduce food alllergens
"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I feel like this gives more of the answer behind while youâ€™re doing things and some better examples
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response A felt very non-specific when reading. Response B gave more practical examples
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A may be more factual, only because of the information in place about the iron fortified cereal. Some providers feel very strongly about this and probably should be considered an option across the board for babies transitioning to solid foods. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I appreciate the mention of choking as well as their take on allergies.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response A is not as accurate. The recommendation of introducing protein foods does not have to wait until infants are older.  Although I would say both prompts lack the comment or guidance that at 6 months of age breastmilk or iron fortified infant formula is still the primary nutrition provider for infants. In addition they provide no guidance on portion size and the fact you might have to offer a food multiple times before a child accepts it. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, for the same reasons above. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives examples of allergic reactions. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Both address the importance of vitamins and minerals through pureed fruits and vegetables, and later introduction of proteins. But B provides signs/symptoms of allergens to help the parent identify an allergen. As well as information regarding choking hazards in solid foods."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Honestly children and infants are not my specialty but I do know option B is very important to TALK to an MD before introducing new foods that a child had an allergic reaction to. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B give the information and then explains why.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Gives specifics on allergic reactions
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"They are both factual, I think B presents it better. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Babies can start with age appropriate meats right away as it is a great way for babies to get protein and iron. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B give more detailed information overall
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,It just gives more facts about the allergens and not just a list of foods to try
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,preferred how Response B explained what adverse reactions a parent should watch for and encouraged frequent inclusions of allergens to reduce likelihood of allergies developing. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B provides more specific examples of food choices to introduce. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both are similar but B is most helpful for parent.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response B gets too deep in the weeds with the allergens. The response A may be more vague - but it is easier to understand. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I would still say response B, because it is more specific/less vague, which actually makes it easier to know what to do & what to look out for. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,There are more practical details. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Both are very easy to understand. However B feels more like guidelines that can be followed. Which most parents would probably appreciate with regards to their child, especially if it the first child."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,However article A seemed to be at a lower reading level. Something patients find helpful is having mini paragraphs that bullet point or outline important information topics. Sometimes simple though can be deceiving. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B translates well to any level of learning/comprehension
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,More general and doesn't use as many health terms
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A comes across less wordy
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A provides the same information with fewer words, which often helps with understanding. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Explains food allergies in more detail, what to look for if child has a reaction
Importance of introducing soft foods to prevent choking. 
stay observant"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Itâ€™s more to the point and just read easier
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Most people need specifics. Response A assumes parents know what reactions to watch for and doesn't encourage including common allergens in diets. Some parents may just avoid all together out of fear of reaction
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is more thorough and provides more examples of iron containing foods and then foods to combine with that contain Vitamin C to improve absorption. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives more advice and mentions the heme iron which is better accepted in our bodies.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A is more practical with pairing of the iron and vitamin C. B is more general and doesn't specifically pair foods at each meal as it did in response A. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B is more clear, organized, and approachable for a client to read. It explains the difference between heme iron and non-heme iron, recommends pairing plant-based iron sources with a source of vitamin C & gives examples, & discusses foods that can inhibit iron absorption. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This gives more detail on which types of high iron foods are more easily absorbed. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B provided much more details than A did. Especially when it came to what foods to include, exclude, and why. But I was very taken aback by the apology in the beginning. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I think the second response sounds good because it doesn't give a meal plan, it gives you actual tools and ideas to help increase your iron. For example, talks about what an inhibit the absorption of iron. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B is easy to understand, leaves it open to preference, and covers a bit more information that A"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like its suggestions better
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is more exact and I like the included tip of using cast iron pots
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"I like the set up of this response better. Response A feels jumbled with the information, while response B flows better and helps with better understanding. 
While response A does discuss proper sources of iron, response B discusses they different types of iron, and how to maximize the absorption from this nonheme iron. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Explains that Heme iron is better absorbed
Importance of including foods high in Vit C
explains foods that inhibit FE absorption"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,The information is laid out in an easier format to interpret and understand it has both facts and examples
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"While response A has a few more iron rich food examples, it feels limiting telling the patient what foods have to be eaten at what mealtime. Time of day these foods are included doesn't impact absorption and some patients could assume this is what it is saying. It would have been more helpful if it said ""mealtime examples could be:"" or something similar. Response B does better at explaining what foods aid in and inhibit iron absorption"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is much more specific and provides more food examples. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B covers more advice and explains it better.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B is more comprehensive b/c it includes the foods to avoid to inhibit iron absorption which is missing in response A. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it discusses what to include more of, what to pair with iron-rich foods, and what to avoid while consuming iron-rich foods. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,This gives more in depth information. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B explains which types of iron are more readily accepted and which foods will aid or inhibit iron's absorption. Something most people tend not to think about. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"The question was not to provide a meal plan, it was more of where do I start to add more sources of iron in my lifestyle. It also explains that animal proteins are better absorbed than plant sources. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B touches on sources of iron as well as types. It also goes over information on what is best to pair with and what to avoid when consuming iron rich foods. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,more detailed
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A is better at including specific meal times and suggestions
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A, This response provides meal and snack examples to add iron with tips on how to increase iron absorption. It answers the question asked while providing education. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"explains Heme is better absorbed
Vit c helps body absorb more iron
explains food that inhibit Fe absorption"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives a little bit more specific examples like the 70% chocolate
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"includes good examples, reads clearly, and encourages meeting with an RD to meet with their specific needs"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"My opinion that response A still provides more information based on managing anemia. While response B does include information about heme iron, the recommendations for those items are in response A, just not specified but overall response A is more thorough and accurate. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives more advice and explains the pairing of vit C foods and the spacing on foods that may limit iron absorption. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More accurate as it discusses the foods to avoid. I think they both need to explain that depending on the severity of anemia a nutritional supplement and blood monitoring may be needed. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it provides the explanations for its recommendations, rather than only example meals to eat, without much more information outside of those examples. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B included heme and non-heme iron, and it also included foods the inhibit absorption. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B provides more accurate information on iron and what can affect its absorption.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"The importance of knowing vitamin C paired with iron can increase the absorption is important. It is accurate to tell a patient to drink OJ, but explaining the why is also just as important. Especially since the person may not even have OJ as a part of their lifestyle, culture, food preference, or daily intake. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I feel like response B leans more towards the bioavailability of iron from the different sources without over-complicating the response.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both are fine
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"The specific facts shared are aligned with nutrition guidelines and again, I like the included tip of using cast iron"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Discussing the cookware, sources of iron, and nutrients that enhance/inhibit absorption is all accurate and what is recommended to improve anemia "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Explains that Heme iron is better absorbed
Importance of including foods high in Vit C
explains foods that inhibit FE absorption
Importance of seeing a healthcare provider"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B uses the word mindful which I think is a word that is very current that people can respond to
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More specific to detail about heme vs non-heme iron and when ascorbic acid needs to be included for improved absorption. Better information on foods that inhibit absorption
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I like response B particularly because it pointed out and encouraged meeting with a health care professional to devise a plan appropriate for a growing child. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I thought that the meal suggestions/ swaps were more realistic for a 10 year old especially one who many tend to be more picky.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Mention of HCP involvement is critical and makes response B better. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B begins more positively, stating ""There are plenty of plant-based sources of protein..."" rather than ""Navigating a healthy diet for your 10-year-old son who doesnâ€™t like to eat meat can be challenging...."" Response B also clearly lists out high-protein vegetarian options to incorporate more of, provides examples for how to include these ingredients in his meals, and recommends consulting a pediatrician. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives more kid-friendly options. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A seems more applicable to the situation, it offers ideas for sneaking foods into his diet in addition to examples."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think that response B was more important because it mentioned the importance of growth. This is not my specialty but I do know that growth in adolescence is very important (growth charts ect). I have a few children in the past we have been stunted due to inadequate nutrition. I do like the first sentence in response A better because it acknowledges the difficulty of the question. But response B also seems more detailed.  
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives more examples and encourages creativity of incorporation. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More information is provided
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Example B is more detailed and I like the recommendation to see a pediatrician. I would prefer it said dietitian rather than nutritionist.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A just provides more direct recommendations and examples to increase protein intake. I like that it also gives swaps for the foods they enjoy already (i.e switching to high protein pasta). Eggs are often forgotten to be a good source of protein, and I like that it mentions this food as well. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B includes more food options that a 10 yr old would most likely eat
I like that B encourages parents to seek the guidance from pediatrician or dietitian."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"it gives the definition of plant-based proteins and proteins from dairy products in a brief, concise fashion with specific ex"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"factual, better information of high protein foods, more practical examples"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think response A provided a few more ideas for application. They both provided good examples of alternative protein sources, but response A gave more application and incorporation ideas. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Both are good but A seemed to have more realistic substitutions or options for mom.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response A provides more kid appropriate examples as tacos and burgers. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it is more positive and makes it clear that it's very doable to maintain a healthy diet for her son without including meat. It then provides clear information on what foods to include and how to incorporate them."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,These suggestions are more tailored to a kid. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,A offers tips in addition to information. B falls a little flat on this front. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I think response B goes into more about how the patient should follow a more plant based diet compared to response A that says to start out with other sources of protein first. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B focuses on the alternative protein sources and how to incorporate them into the diet of a 10-year-old, as well as making sure that they know to reach out to healthcare professionals to ensure he is meeting his needs during critical times. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Better with the details
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B has good examples and provides actionable advice on how to integrate the examples in to meals and snacks - which I think fits better with the question. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response A just gives better examples in my opinions of foods that are commonly eaten among 10 year olds and how to make them high in protein without the meat. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"More ideas for food options in B
A talks about smoothie three times"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,it gives more specific examples of how to add these
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Gave good examples of how to incorporate high protein food items into dishes a 10 year old may eat
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I think because the question specifically uses the term ""incorporate"", prompt A is a bit better. As I noted above, response A provided more ideas of adding protein and providing more kid friendly ideas to incorporate the protein into generally already acceptable foods. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Information on both are similar but I would personally not recommend increasing milk for protein in general as too much can prevent iron absorption and if the child is already limiting a majority of animal proteins he may be at risk for iron deficiency anemia. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Due to the HCP involvement I am choosing response B. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B, because it is more clear for a client and provides more information. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,There are a lot of examples and creative suggestions. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Both appear accurate, but again A feels more applicable to the parent's plight."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B provided more reasoning and ideas but mostly to follow up with care. Response A I think it stated better however if the mother misreads something or doesn't know how to get all essential amino acids in a plant based diet, the 10 year old could be lacking certain nutrients. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both are accurate but I believe response B more fully answers the question
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More details
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"They are both accurate, but I like the detail in response B"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"This response provided more specific swaps in the diet to increase the protein intake (using bean burgers, lentil tacos, chickpea pasta, etc.) "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"More details about food options, talks about protein rich vegetables.
Encourages parents to seek the guidance of a pediatrician or dietitian
"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,it is a better overall response that gives the why behind what the parents need to do to help the 10-year-old
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response B listed broccoli and spinach as high protein, which is inaccurate"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B is just better overall with the detail that it provides. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think a key thing to consider when switching milk types is the protein amount in each product. I appreciate that it discusses this while also explaining the pro/con of oat and almond.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More comprehensive and explanatory - Response A misses mentioning B12 as a potential nutrient issue. Both prompts should mention label reading as not all plant-based milks are fortified. Both prompts should also mention looking at the label for added sugars. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"I like Response A better for this scenario, because it gives a concise yet educational response to this parent to help make an informed decision. I like that it highlights that the key difference is that plant-based milks have a lower protein content, but with a well-rounded diet they can still meet their protein needs. I also like that it gives examples of plant-based protein & calcium sources to make sure to incorporate in their child's diet. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I feel that A gives an unbiased opinion and ends with a statement to summarize how to help the client make a good decision.  
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B addresses all the pros and cons of each milk. Something I noticed very quickly on A when it failed to mention the low protein content of oat milk in favor of mentioning it's fortification.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B gives a whole rounded answer. Especially explaining cows milk provides different nutrition initially is helpful. Response A says oat milk is the same nutrition as cows milk which is not factual. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I feel like it is easier to understand at any education level. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I prefer the way it is laid out in paragraphs
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It discusses each alternative in more detail
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,this provides more detail of each milk alternative and allows the reader to make a better choice based on their child's need. It's just more clear as to what benefits the milk alternatives contain and why this may or may not be the right choice based on the child's current diet. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"B details each of the milk alternatives in more detail, explaining why each alt milk might be a good alternative to Cow's milk"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"The first response list all necessary information, but I think it doesnâ€™t read as well as the second response. Does they both give some good information but I think the second responses easier to understand."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More clearly explained comparison to the milks. I liked that it also explained what role each nutrient plays in the body
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B does a better job explaining and assessing the specific nutrients and vitamins to be concerned with. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both responses mention the fortification of milk products which is valuable. I appreciate that response B mentions the protein as well. For an adolescent I would strongly encourage a product that was similar in protein to dairy milk like soy or pea over oat/ almond. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Identified more nutrients of importance - response A is missing B12. However response B has an error - oat milk is not a good source of fiber - this general statement cannot be made. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B includes more specifics as to the nutrient composition of cow's milk vs. plant-based milk. It mentions vitamin B12 & fiber, which response A does not, and it discusses the importance of each nutrient mentioned. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B gives a more in depth explanation on each milkâ€™s nutrition facts. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B reviews each option more in-depth to provide a fuller picture for this parent. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Saying that different types of plant based milk and cows milk has different nutritional needs, similar to how each person needs different needs based on their medical condition and/or how cows milk may be a good or bad choice for some people. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"While response A goes more in depth about specific content, response B covers the macros without unnecessary information"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I don't think either says why cow's milk is bad
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,It discussed the pros and cons of each in detail. The first response was very brief when discussing alternatives and then went into other parts of the diet. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,response B compares the milk alternatives' nutritional components to cows milk rather than just stating it can be an alternative to cow's milk like it does in response A 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B explains in detail what nutrients each alt milk has
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,Response is definitely just more factual
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"neither response is perfect, but i preferred response B because it separated the milks a litter more clearly. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I think response B is just better overall with more detail and hits all aspects and concerns when choosing an alternative milk and information about the nutrients to incorporate. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I don't like that response A says that it gave a blanket 'it's a good substitute' statement. I think the answer would be more nuanced as mentioned in response B. You would really need to consider the families goals and the child's specific nutritional reasons for considering a dairy alternative in context of full diet.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Both prompts would benefit from a chart showcasing the differences between the milks in an easier to comprehend manner. I am choosing response B as better as the pea protein highlight of it being highest in protein is better. In addition response B explains why B12 is important and calcium and vitamin D so has a more educational component. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"Response A provides a better educational approach for long-term success, as it highlights the key differences between cow's milk & plant-based milks, and then discusses how to incorporate plant-based milk into a healthy overall well-rounded diet. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,"A described how milk alternatives can be used in a healthy, well-balanced diet. It educates the client while helping them make a decision. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,B again provides more information for this parent to help their child make a decision on a more beneficial milk for them.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"The end of response B talks about the importance of a balance diet and how cows milk helps supports a person with brain function, Even when mentioning pea protein, it is not providing the exact same nutrition but has more protein than oat milk. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"Response B leaves the choice up to the parent/child, which would encourage a decision that is easier to stick with. Plus, it focuses on the need to consume a balanced diet on top of non-dairy milk."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,More thorough
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response A,I do like the additional information about options to complete the nutrient profile with consuming non-diary milk. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,"with response A, it comes across that all milk alternatives are fortified with these nutrients which is not always the case. with the use of ""fortified versions"" in response B, it indicates the reader does need to look at the labels and be sure they are getting the right version of the product for their child. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Clearly explained differences between the different alt milks compared to cow's milk
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,Response B gives better tools for the patient to make their own decisions
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Response B,I liked that it also explained what role each nutrient plays in the body as well as encouraged a balanced diet with diverse nutrient sources will help fill in any potential gaps.
