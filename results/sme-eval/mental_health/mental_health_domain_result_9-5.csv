It defines the minimum and common symptom criteria for depression. ",Response B,"The statement also provides a fairly accurate explanation. However, CBT as the only example of a technique to address symptomology is not effective for everyone. ACT mindfulness is also just as effective alone or combined with CBT.",Response A,"First, I disagree with Response A and Response B about CBT (Trauma-Focused CBT: T-CBT is more accurate - which is different from CBT). Second, I am not familiar with some of the options in Response A or Response B. ",Response A,I selected Response A because the statement encourages readers to seek assistance from a trained mental health professional. Response B does not make that statement. ,Response B,"Response B does provide ""more"" not better educational information.",Response A,"I chose Response A because of this statement: ""If you are concerned that you may have symptoms of schizophrenia, it is crucial to seek help from a mental health professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis."" ",Response B,"Response A makes it clear that schizophrenia is a serious condition and left untreated can lead to major life-changing consequences. However, Response B does a better job at providing a better educational approach. ",Response B,"Response A and Response B are good. However, I like to be more cautious and ethical. Response B encourages the individual to seek assistance ""If you are concerned that you may have symptoms of schizophrenia"" and ""to seek help from a mental health professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis."" Moreover, telling the client/patient that there are  ""treatment options for schizophrenia"" and what type.  Finally, the response ends with encouragement for an overall improvement of lifestyle and general well-being.

This line in Response A and Response B is inaccurate ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)."" The current DSM is the DSM-5-TR (Text Revision). 

Second, I have never had to request ""lab tests and imaging studies"" to ""rule out other medical conditions that could be causing similar symptoms.""

Third, I disagree with this statement telling the patient about a specific questionnaire ""Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)."" They can find MDQ online and might try to self-diagnose.
