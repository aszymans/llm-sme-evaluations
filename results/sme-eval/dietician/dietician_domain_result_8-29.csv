",Response A,"I think response A does a better job because it addresses eating smaller more frequent meals as well as limiting sugary drinks as these are both important components with managing blood sguars. ",Response A,"I think A still meets this one as well ober option B. It addresses not just food choices but the frequency as well. Additionally, it also encourages talking to your medical professional about the plan as that is important to individualize the plan.

",Response B,"I think the level of detail and examples that response B provides helps to make it clearer and easier to understand. ",Response B,"I think response B does hit on all of the components that are important to consider with CKD. I like that it emphasized the importance of coming up with a customized plan at the end of it since not necessarily each component or recommendation will be the same for every person. ",Response B," I think B is an overall better response as it does answer the question but provides more details about the overall implication of weight loss as whole and the other aspects that are important to consider and identifying that it is not a ""quick fix"".  I also like that it addresses the desire to overcompensate and that this can be detrimental to the goal. ",Response B,"I think some of the claims that response A makes are not well studied and not entirely agreed upon among medical professionals. ",Response B,"I think B probably better fits what a dietitian would recommend and agree with. Dietitians generally look at the whole picture and think to options that are most sustainable for patients. While there are claims that IF can help improve insulin resistance, we can do that with healthy foods as well and would opt for that in terms of long-term benefits. ",Response A,"I think response A is a better overall response as it just addresses the concern of fruit and carbohydrate in general with regards to diabetes. Response B encourages fruit maybe more than I would recommend. ",Response A,"I think response A is generally more basic and is not as scientific so would be easier to understand and follow. ",Response B,"Response B probably does a better job answering the exact question but is not as thorough and does not look at the whole picture that is important to do when it comes to carbohydrate and diabetes. ",Response A,"I think response A is better overall at addressing the pros and cons of artificial sweeteners and honey.

",Response A,"I think response A does a better job of promoting the overall balance of using either of these options to sweeten foods. However, I would also never choose to promote honey as any source of vitamins/minerals just because it's such a small amount and should be used sparingly in general. I think it is important that it pointed out considering ""individual health goals"".",Response B,"Response B is more thorough and provides more detail about the overall concerns of some carbohydrate foods while including that our bodies do like and need some carbohydrate. ",Response B,"I think response B does a better job providing the truth about carbohydrate but also addressing some of the harmful components of it as well. ",Response B,"Response B was much more detailed. It put the emphasis on maintaining overall balance of carbohydrate intake while still choose complex carbohydrates of simple carbohydrates. I like that it provided the details about why blood sugar spikes can be harmful and the diseases this can lead to.  ",Response B,"I think response B will better meet the patient's caloric needs. I do not think response A will do that with the foods suggested. ",Response B,"Response B will better meet the calorie goal of the patient. Response B also provides specific alternatives to foods containing peanut that the patient can choose instead. ",Response B,"Response B will better meet the patients specific requests. It will meet the calorie needs as well as help the patient avoid peanuts. ",Response B,"Response is a much more specific and detailed response. It provides specific details about how much protein to get and can be tailored to the individual. ",Response B,"Response B provides that information in the answer. It provides the protein goal for someone who is quite active.  It hits on other nutrition concerns such as iron and other vitamins that can be lacking in a vegan diet. ",Response B,"I think overall B is still the best response here. I like that response A encourages the athlete to contact a dietitian however response B touches on more of the aspects that I would want to address as a dietitian. ",Response B,"Response B is much more thorough and relevant as it does address the concerns surrounding alcohol consumption, fast food intake, and caffeine on performance. ",Response B,"I do think response B is more personalized as it does include more of the aspects that a 25 year old may generally be tempted to fall into such as alcohol, high calorie convenience foods, and fast food",Response B,"I do still think B is a better long-term approach and provides more practical/basic information and guidance. ",Response B,"I think response B is more appropriate for someone who is of the college age. It provides a more complete response for addressing the components with foods and fluids. ",Response B,"Response B is better as it provides more general information and does not touch on the specifics of the nutrients it provides and would be better for the general population. ",Response B,"I like that response B address hydration and importance of avoiding certain sugary drinks and items that we know do not help with focus and stress management. Response B does provide some specific examples but not too many and some more commonly utilized foods that would be accessible to a college age individual. ",Response B,"Response B provides more options for the individual. While response A is a good response it is just not as detailed and does not provide as many options. ",Response B,"I do think option B is more tailored to the individual. It just provides more suggested options for the individual. I do think when giving meal and food ideas, including specifics is very important. ",Response B,"I think B is still a more acceptable response as well. It gives several ideas and examples that most dietitians likely would agree with. ",Response B,"I really like that response B provided information about supplements because for several people this tends to be a more common option. ",Response A,"I think response A does a better job of explaining the abbreviations whereas response B does not do that. This may be easier for someone to understand, even if they do not know what those words mean, it provides credibility. ",Response B,"I do not agree with pointing out the fortified options when it comes to dairy or eggs in response A. These generally contribute quite minimal volumes and are not nearly as beneficial as the other options. ",Response A,"Overall, I like response A better. However, I would not recommend banana in a smoothie for a diabetic and like the smoothie recommendation from response B better. I do think there are more suggestion in response A that are appropriate for the pt other than the smoothie. ",Response A,"Response A is better long term as it provides more examples and ideas of incorporating foods. It also provides a few more details about the why behind the recommendations and what this does for blood sugars. ",Response B,"Response B provides fewer examples for the pt to incorporate and generally fewer details. ",Response B,"I think B is overall better because it provides an actionable plan for the pt. The patient could look at this and implement it tomorrow. There are specific ideas provided that would make up an entire day for her. ",Response A,"Response A provides more ideas of foods that the patient could include. She would have to put those ideas together to come up with a specific day to day meal plan but may be a better options long term for her. ",Response B,"I think B still is more tailored to her as an individual and does give her want she asked for, a dietary plan that could work day to day. She may get tired of the choices recommended but it does provide what she asked for. ",Response B,"Response B is focuses more on the whole picture and provides a longer more sustainable solution for this patient's concerns. ",Response B,"Response B addresses more than just the Mediterranean diet. It includes information about strategies for weight loss as well as exercise.  ",Response B,"Response B is more thorough and hits other aspects of what this patient needs beyond just the Mediterranean diet. It hits on exercise which we know is important as well as hitting on some key components for weight loss. ",Response A,"I think response A is more comprehensive because it hits more on the medical concerns around following a ketogenic diet. ",Response B,"I think response B is probably easier to for someone without much medical knowledge. It is a more general and basic response. ",Response A,"I like response A a bit better as it does provide a more comprehensive response to the long-term implications of following a ketogenic diet. I think response B is good and may hit on more of the idea of considering a whole lifestyle component, but A is more specific and detailed with medical conditions and concerns. ",Response B,"I like the specific details of response B. I thought it did a good job of explaining why aspects of this item may be concerning and the effects of that. ",Response A,Response A is more general and does not provide as much medical jargon and language that may be more difficult to understand.,Response B,"As noted in other responses, B provides more detail and more content regarding potential effects and concerns of incorporating this item. It does a good job of including information about the benefits and potential concerns. ",Response B,"I think response B provides more details and explanations as to why it is a good gluten free option. It provides details about some of its other nutritional benefits as well. ",Response B,"I like that response B provides more detail about the specific nutrients that quinoa provides. ",Response B,"I think that the detail and variety of examples/explanation that response B provides makes it clearer and easier to understand. ",Response A,"Response A is more specific related to whole grains. It is quite detailed and provides more ideas for including whole grains in the diet. ",Response A,"Response A gives more information about the specific benefits of whole grains. It touches on the glycemic index as well as the benefits of whole grains providing more vitamins and minerals. ",Response A,"A is more detailed with some of the science behind whole grains whereas B, which is a good response, is more general and focuses less on the details. ",Response A,"Response A is much more thorough and detailed as a response. It does a better job of explaining what gluten is, what it does, and then details about why some people need to avoid it. ",Response A,"The response of A is very thorough, and I think provides more details around the responses of wheat/gluten as an allergen.",Response A,"Response A is very similar to what I would address and provide with patients. ",Response B,"I think response B is just more thorough and complete. I like that response B includes information about the potential reactions that can occur from consuming these foods. ",Response B,"I am not sure that sesame falls into the category of the other allergens just yet. While it is common, I think the others still hit that top list.",Response A,"I think response B is potentially a bit more inaccurate in terms of how it discusses ages that allergens specifically affect. I am not sure that that is entirely true as allergies can affect people of all ages, and many people do not necessarily grow out of them. ",Response B,"I like response B better however, I do wish it contained more information about the iron fortified cereal that response A provides. I think response B does a better job of including more of the why behind some of the concerns and anxieties that come along with infant feeding. ",Response A,"Response A may be more factual, only because of the information in place about the iron fortified cereal. Some providers feel very strongly about this and probably should be considered an option across the board for babies transitioning to solid foods. ",Response B,"Response B provides more specific examples of food choices to introduce. ",Response A,"Response A is more thorough and provides more examples of iron containing foods and then foods to combine with that contain Vitamin C to improve absorption. ",Response A,"Response A is much more specific and provides more food examples. ",Response A,"My opinion that response A still provides more information based on managing anemia. While response B does include information about heme iron, the recommendations for those items are in response A, just not specified but overall response A is more thorough and accurate. ",Response B,"I like response B particularly because it pointed out and encouraged meeting with a health care professional to devise a plan appropriate for a growing child. ",Response A,"I think response A provided a few more ideas for application. They both provided good examples of alternative protein sources, but response A gave more application and incorporation ideas. ",Response A,"I think because the question specifically uses the term ""incorporate"", prompt A is a bit better. As I noted above, response A provided more ideas of adding protein and providing more kid friendly ideas to incorporate the protein into generally already acceptable foods. ",Response B,"I think response B is just better overall with the detail that it provides. ",Response B,"Response B does a better job explaining and assessing the specific nutrients and vitamins to be concerned with. ",Response B,"I think response B is just better overall with more detail and hits all aspects and concerns when choosing an alternative milk and information about the nutrients to incorporate. ",25

B slightly gives more.,Response B,I think the flow of B is better and the recommendations are better.,Response B,Both made sense but B gave much better and useful information,Response B,B gave better advice particularly on types of f/v to consume and water limits based on CKD level.,Response B,I like that B mentioned that it should not be used as a quick fix and noted that weight loss involves a full process of multiple lifestyle factors.,Response A,"I think they are both factually similar, explaining the main point of this diet, main concerns and potential positives.",Response B,I appreciate that response B notes some situations where this would not be ideal or where it would need to be flexible and also notes that it is not a quick fix. I also disagree with A where it say you would not need to have a 'strict diet' because you can still overconsume in a short time frame if you are not choosing the right meal options.,Response B,It is more tailored and explained the fruit specific question better.,Response A,"Both are close, B uses some more specific terms that I would imagine someone with T2DM would know like glycemic index, but are harder concepts.",Response B,I think that B focused on the question about the fruit more where A gave general diabetic/ lifestyle advice. I would think the patient would be more open to statement B because it answered the question without giving any additional unsolicited advice.,Response B,"I think B is more clear for an average reader and does a good job comparing the two and giving pro and con of each. ",Response A,"A gives slightly more information although I am not familiar with the studies noted so I am not sure if I would agree with mentioning them if they were not from suitable sources, but assuming they are, it does give more information. ",Response B,"I think both would be acceptable with the caveat I mentioned in 2nd question of assuming the studies mentioned were legitimate. ",Response B,"I do not like the opening paragraph of A. It makes it sound as if there is a true 50/50 debate in nutrition professionals when this is not the case on blanket idea of 'carbs are bad'. ",Response B,"The facts in both make sense and are valid I just disagree with some of the phrasing around carbs in statement one. Most populations will need carbs and both mention the healthier/'better' options and why but I disagree with last statement of response A that impact of carbs will vary on preference. I think this can be damaging and prevent people from even wanting to eat a 'good' carb. ",Response B,"B explains what a carb is at its core first, in a neutral way. Both mention that not all carbs are equal and impact that both types can have on the body. I appreciate that B says carbs are not 'inherently harmful' which I agree with. ",Response B,"I think the question is a little unclear because she says manage weight but not if she has a desire to lose/ gain or manage it by sustaining. I think B gives more culturally appropriate suggestions that writer might be more inclined to follow assuming they meet calorie goals. ",Response B,I don't think A really mentioned any Filipino dishes or spices. Soy sauce and garlic are very broad and used throughout most of Asia where things like calamansi are very Filipino specific.,Response B,"B gives more ideas for the writer on cuisine she likes and notes more peanut substitution options. ",Response B,"I think this is better answer because it notes food/ vitamin pairing which is helpful for less bioavailable options and mentions importance of electrolytes. ",Response B,This would give the athlete a more targeted goal for their protein needs and ways to combine foods throughout meal plan.,Response B,I appreciate that A notes to speak with sports RD but I do agree with all the information given in B and if someone was seriously training for a marathon I would imagine they would find the more specific direction helpful.,Response B,I think these are almost the same and written in a similar way but the mention of caffeine and alcohol in B is an added suggestion that I think could be relevant and important for this person.,Response B,I would say they are equal. Both mention similar topics and reasons with B giving slightly more suggestions.,Response B,Same answer as above. Both give ideas and explanations that I think are good.,Response B,I think these are very similar but I like that B gave snack ideas that can be easy to take on the go.,Response B,"It is not as detailed as the first with reasons why, but contains more action based info.",Response B,It gives actual ideas for snacks and drinks.,Response B,"Again, very close but B gives some more reasonings while both give similar meal suggestions.",Response B,I like the mention of bulk prepping and giving some more context to suggestions.,Response B,I think they are both similar. I chose B because it explained itself more.,Response A,"Very close, but I think A is better because it focuses on foods and answers question without too much depth.",Response A,I think A gives more actual food options and would be better understood in general population.,Response B,I think both are good but B gives more science and omega 3 specific information,Response B,"I think this was easier to read and I appreciate that it mentioned the importance of planning a specific menu with their healthcare team. ",Response B,I think they are similar in suggestions and information.,Response B,A mentioned more details about specific items and noted portions and pairings in the ending statement.,Response A,They are close but A is more thorough in answering all her concerns.,Response A,They both gave similar information on food options but A mentioned the prep itself.,Response A,I think they are close but I like the options mentioned in A regarding batch meal prep and tools the person could use. My only issue is it said to 'drink plenty of water' and that could be misleading if pt is on fluid limitations.,Response A,A is easy to understand and focused.,Response A,"Both give accurate info but A focuses more on their diet interests and preference. ",Response A,B seemed a bit generic where A was more tailored to the diet preference of patient.,Response A,I think the science and balance of A is better.,Response A,Both are easy.,Response A,I like that A gives specific examples of when keto may be recommended. I don't love how B makes the pros/cons seem comparable. A ketogenic diet is really a medical diet and should only be used with guidance to balance level of ketosis.,Response B,I appreciate the more in depth information of response B regarding the fish size.,Response A,A covers basics and B gives some more explanation or detail.,Response B,"B explains why olive oil is a good fat option, why yellowfin is a particularly tricky fish option (opposed to lower mercury like skipjack or light).",Response A,"I think A gets the point across, answers the question, and is easy to read.",Response B,They give similar information but B gives more information.,Response A,"A is more concise and easier to understand. ",Response A,"I think A is more thorough. ",Response A,Neither gives a ton of information but A mentions more benefits.,Response A,Similar but A is slightly better as it notes protein and glycemic index difference and teaches about reading food labels.,Response A,A gives more information but both are correct.,Response B,I think they address it equally.,Response A,A is slightly more detailed.,Response A,I like that A mentions food labels specifically.,Response B,B gives better examples and explains allergies better.,Response B,B addressed more symptoms.,Response B,B gives specific signs to look for and mentions newer research of early introduction of allergens.,Response B,I appreciate the mention of choking as well as their take on allergies.,Response B,Both are similar but B is most helpful for parent.,Response B,B gives more advice and mentions the heme iron which is better accepted in our bodies.,Response B,B covers more advice and explains it better.,Response B,"B gives more advice and explains the pairing of vit C foods and the spacing on foods that may limit iron absorption. ",Response A,I thought that the meal suggestions/ swaps were more realistic for a 10 year old especially one who many tend to be more picky.,Response A,Both are good but A seemed to have more realistic substitutions or options for mom.,Response A,"Information on both are similar but I would personally not recommend increasing milk for protein in general as too much can prevent iron absorption and if the child is already limiting a majority of animal proteins he may be at risk for iron deficiency anemia. ",Response B,I think a key thing to consider when switching milk types is the protein amount in each product. I appreciate that it discusses this while also explaining the pro/con of oat and almond.,Response B,"Both responses mention the fortification of milk products which is valuable. I appreciate that response B mentions the protein as well. For an adolescent I would strongly encourage a product that was similar in protein to dairy milk like soy or pea over oat/ almond. ",Response B,I don't like that response A says that it gave a blanket 'it's a good substitute' statement. I think the answer would be more nuanced as mentioned in response B. You would really need to consider the families goals and the child's specific nutritional reasons for considering a dairy alternative in context of full diet.,25

",Response B,"While I would say they are both accurate. I felt response B was more comprehensive. ",Response B,"Response A was too generic - it didn't really give any foods to eat or not to eat. Response B was much better as it listed high sodium foods, high potassium foods so it provides useful and practical guidance for an individual. ",Response B,"Response B provided information that a patient/client could take home that day and start acting on while response A was not helpful. ",Response B,"While response B is more helpful b/c it lists foods to avoid and to consume based on Na, K, and protein - the level of CKD is really the factor that needs identified. The prompt should really be provide guidance for someone with CKD stage 2 or stage 3 b/c each level comes with different nutrients recommendations and so forth. ",Response A,"I feel the explanation is more fluid and organized in response A. ",Response A,"I think it's important to include the side effects of intermittent fasting. ",Response A,"This one does a better job of recognizing the benefits, mechanism of action and negative consequences than response B which seems to be more one-sided. ",Response B,"Provides more explanation of natural sugar versus added sugar - explaining the difference. ",Response A,"Simpler - doesn't go into glycemic index and is just more straight forward. ",Response B,"I prefer response B b/c it's more educational and provides specifics on the benefits of fiber on blood sugar. For both responses - the prompt didn't ask about exercise so while it's important for DM - it's not on track for the prompt if you have a limited character prompt - I would rather see more specifics on balancing eating fruits with protein or fat to delay glucose absorption. ",Response A,"This was more balanced to the advantages and disadvantages of both options. Response B seemed very positive towards honey while Response A mentioned the fructose and lack of vitamins/minerals which is more truth than touting honey benefits. ",Response A,"Covers both advantages and disadvantages of both options better. ",Response A,"I think most RDs are going to give a balanced answer. I think both responses need to also include that the real goal would be to eliminate or reduce both added sugars (honey) and artificial sugars and to use fruits as a source of sweetness as much as possible. ",Response A,"More accurate. Easier to follow. ",Response A,"This statement in response B is not true - ""potentially increasing the risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases if consumed in excess."" Refined carbohydrates alone do not increase the risk necessarily so the statement is misleading. ",Response B,"Response B does give more information and is more thorough. It would be the better choice if the statement about increasing the risk was more accurate/reworded. ",Response B,"More tailored to the Filipino cuisine by focusing more on specific ingredients and meals tailored to that preference. ",Response B,"They both are accurate but felt response B was more tailored and fully provided Filipino cuisine requests. ",Response B,"Fully provided more Filipino cuisine in response B (especially lunch/dinner) ",Response B,"Response B is far more detailed - provides protein goals, more specific nutrient deficiencies common for vegans - it's more useable information. However, I would still suggest a RD recommendation. ",Response B,"Provides more detail and more information about overall well balanced by mentioning nutrients specifically and hydration. ",Response B,"Response A goes into carbohydrate importance and the reality is vegans are by default going to get plenty of carbohydrates. It's a waste of a paragraph. Response B covers the keys to vegan issues- protein, nutrients lacking and then also covers hydration. It's a more well rounded answer. ",Response B,"Response A didn't emphasize the benefits of the fats enough - it was an afterthought in response A and really shouldn't be. Response B offered a more well balanced answer. ",Response A,"I am only choosing response A b/c of the comment about choosing protein at each meal. Response B did not provide any frequency of the important protein nutrient. However, both responses were good on this one. ",Response B,"Response B provides a better explanation of the importance of each macronutrient in performance and recovery which a client can build on this knowledge. ",Response B,"Response B gave more examples of specific foods- especially when it comes to snack options. Response A missed snacks and didn't emphasize hydration as much as response B. ",Response B,"Response A was too detailed- college kids aren't going to care about the specific vitamins and such in different fruits/veggies. A more generalized approach from Response B is more audience appropriate. ",Response B,"Response B made more sense for a college student. They likely need a more basic answer like response B - they may not be able to afford expensive foods such as salmon. They need snack ideas. Both responses missed any emphasis on limiting processed foods or eating out that would be a huge factor in most college students lives. ",Response B,"Response B gave more ideas and more flexibility within the meals. Response A was more of a 1 day plan. ",Response B,"Response B also mentioned foods to avoid with the hidden sugars and unhealthy fats- that is important to include but likely needs expanded on. ",Response B,"Response B is more well rounded with including foods to eat and foods to avoid (although this part needs expansion). ",Response A,"Response A spells out all the omega-3's fully; response A only focuses on food sources which is the original prompt request. Most people can get enough omega-3's through diet so I would avoid response B b/c it jumps into supplemental sources too fast. ",Response A,"Response A does a better job of explaining omega -3 from fish and omega-3 from plants. However, there is an error - flaxseed oil is a great source of ALA - not a modest source. Response A also talks about how to incorporate these foods into a daily plan which is practical. ",Response A,"Response B is just not thorough - it glances over food choices and then jumps to supplements which is not likely what a RD would do. It also has this statement "" ALA is converted into EPA and DHA in the body, although this conversion process is not very efficient."" - This is old school thinking as we now know many factors impact this conversion. ",Response B,"These were really close for me. I don't feel like one is strongly better than the other but option A was missing anything hydration related. ",Response B,"Response A was missing hydration recommendations. ",Response A,"No hydration mentioned. No mention of working with a HCP for further guidance which is really necessary with DM with strict food preferences. ",Response B,"She asked for meals and response A did not provide that. Response B was much preferred as it gave a few meal options for Breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack. This I find more helpful. ",Response A,"Response A does a better general overall explanation of what is needed for bone health- gluten free options, etc but does not really provide any meals as requested. ",Response B,"I actually think a combination of these prompts is perfect. Response A is missing the meal suggestions but response B is missing any actual explanation that the client needs to better understand the choices recommended. ",Response A,"Response A provides more details- offers foods to eat that fit into the goals. Response B does not. ",Response A,"Response A breaks down the Mediterranean diet more clearly with foods to eat so the person can then go design a meal. Response B while accurate is too broad. ",Response A,"Response A is more specific and actionable. ",Response B,"Response A is not very accurate as the entire paragraph about being hign in protein is not true. A ketogenic diet is not high in protein - it's moderate in protein. ",Response B,"Response B is more general and doesn't get into the nitty gritty of vitamin/mineral deficiencies as with response A. ",Response B,"Response A is just not accurate. In addition to the high protein aspect not being true, the vitamin/mineral deficiencies noted (C, K, Mg) are also not commonly found in ketogenic therapy. Zn, carnitine and Se are more common deficiencies. ",Response B,"Provides more details of what nutrients are in the product and why they are beneficial. Although it is missing the vitamin D and selenium that are briefly mentioned in response A. ",Response A,"Less detail - but easier to comprehend likely for a lower reading threshold. ",Response B,"Offers more specifics about why it's heart healthy - monounsaturated fat. It's gives more details. ",Response B,"These are pretty similar but I thought response b was easier to understand and reads better. ",Response B,"They are both factual. I like how response B goes into more detail with vitamins/minerals it is rich in. ",Response B,"Reads more fluidly. ",Response A,"I feel giving people substitutes is important so by saying eat whole grain bread vs white bread. Advising people (as in response B) to eat these foods - may lead to a calorie excess situation and lead to weight gain which is generally not wanted for most individuals. Giving substitutes is more transferable to home life. ",Response A,"The label reading information in response A of looking for whole grain as 1st ingredient is huge and very very important. That alone makes the prompt more factual. ",Response B,"Response B last paragraph provides far more information about the health benefits of whole grains than response A content which doesn't really specify the health benefits; however, the prompt didn't ask about the health benefits. ",Response A,"Response A provides more details and more specific terminology. ",Response A,"They both are similar but response A I prefer. ",Response A,"Gives more specifics on where gluten can be found. ",Response B,"More detailed - example listing dairy more prevalent in children and including range of reactions. ",Response B,"I think they are both factual and I see minimal difference. ",Response B,"I like response B better as it's clearer and easier to read. Response A just seems to be run on and gets very monotonous in how it reads. Although I do think response B is missing this line "" It's important for individuals with food allergies to carefully read food labels and communicate their allergies to restaurant staff to avoid potential allergic reactions."" ",Response B,"Response A is not as accurate and more vague. ",Response B,"Response A is not as accurate. The recommendation of introducing protein foods does not have to wait until infants are older.  Although I would say both prompts lack the comment or guidance that at 6 months of age breastmilk or iron fortified infant formula is still the primary nutrition provider for infants. In addition they provide no guidance on portion size and the fact you might have to offer a food multiple times before a child accepts it. ",Response A,"I think response B gets too deep in the weeds with the allergens. The response A may be more vague - but it is easier to understand. ",Response A,"A is more practical with pairing of the iron and vitamin C. B is more general and doesn't specifically pair foods at each meal as it did in response A. ",Response B,"Response B is more comprehensive b/c it includes the foods to avoid to inhibit iron absorption which is missing in response A. ",Response B,"More accurate as it discusses the foods to avoid. I think they both need to explain that depending on the severity of anemia a nutritional supplement and blood monitoring may be needed. ",Response B,"Mention of HCP involvement is critical and makes response B better. ",Response A,"I think response A provides more kid appropriate examples as tacos and burgers. ",Response B,"Due to the HCP involvement I am choosing response B. ",Response B,"More comprehensive and explanatory - Response A misses mentioning B12 as a potential nutrient issue. Both prompts should mention label reading as not all plant-based milks are fortified. Both prompts should also mention looking at the label for added sugars. ",Response B,"Identified more nutrients of importance - response A is missing B12. However response B has an error - oat milk is not a good source of fiber - this general statement cannot be made. ",Response B,"Both prompts would benefit from a chart showcasing the differences between the milks in an easier to comprehend manner. I am choosing response B as better as the pea protein highlight of it being highest in protein is better. In addition response B explains why B12 is important and calcium and vitamin D so has a more educational component. ",25

Response A feels more confusing for an average individual, stating ""it is important to be mindful of your sugar intake, but that doesn't mean you have to completely avoid all fruits"" makes it sound like you should be worried about fruit sugar. It also states ""Eating a balanced diet that includes a variety of healthy foods, monitoring portion sizes, and keeping track of your carbohydrate intake can all help to better manage your diabetes and overall health"" but it doesn't explain how to do these things, leaving clients confused.

As an example, response B includes more detail as to why excess consumption of simple carbs can be detrimental (""can lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, potentially increasing the risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases if consumed in excess"") whereas response A is more generalized (""can cause spikes in blood sugar levels and contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess"").",Response B,"I'd say they are both accurate, but response B provides more information to back up its claim. ",Response B,"Response B covers more detail as discussed above, so does a better job of backing up its argument that carbohydrates are not inherently harmful to health. It starts with ""Carbohydrates are a fundamental source of energy for the human body, particularly for the brain and muscles during physical activity"" and ends with ""In essence, carbohydrates themselves are not inherently harmful, ..."" and discusses the nuances of the types of carbohydrates and their health implications. ",Response B,"Response B is clearer & incorporates many more aspects of Filipino cuisine. It also starts with an introductory sentence, and states ""for breakfast, consider..."" and ""for lunch, you might enjoy..."" indicating that these are simply recommendations that can be modified, rather than a strict meal plan. ",Response B,Response B is more specific & incorporates many more aspects of Filipino cuisine.,Response B,"Response B, for the same reason as above. ",Response B,"Response B, because it is much more specific and touches on many more nutritional elements to look out for while training, such as plant protein, calcium, iron, vitamin D, omega-3s, hydration, & electrolytes.

",Response B,"Response B is more applicable long-term, as it provides specific recommendations, gives the reason for the recommendation, and then an example for how to incorporate the recommendation. ",Response A,"Response A provides more nutrition information to back up its response, such as including details about vitamin C, vitamin A, & omega-3s. ",Response B,"Response B does read more clearly for an average individual, providing actionable recommendations such as including whole grains, protein-rich foods, fruits & veggies, healthy fats, & staying hydrated with non-sugary beverages. ",Response B,"Response B, because it provides more actionable and easy to understand recommendations for this individual. ",Response B,"Response B is better overall, as it provides more accurate information in a clearer and more customizable way. Response A mainly just provides 3 recipe examples, without providing more information for the client to build off of and make their own meal plans. On the other hand, response B gives an overview of what to focus on, and then gives some recipe examples. ",Response B,"Response B is more factually accurate, as overnight oats with oats, almond milk, and chia seeds contains no dietary cholesterol, not low dietary cholesterol, and saturated fat plays a larger roll in blood cholesterol than dietary cholesterol does. It also targets the client's questions clearly, for example ""Oats are a fantastic choice for breakfast; they can help lower cholesterol and are quick to prepare.""",Response B,"Response B, because it gives the client the tools they need to move forward, as well as some examples to get them started. ",Response B,"Response B provides more information, such as about how ALA is converted into EPA & DHA in the body, and also discusses omega-3 supplements. ",Response B,"Response B reads more clearly, starting off with fatty fish that contain EPA and DHA, then moving on to plant-based sources for those who don't eat fish & explains how plant-based sources contain ALA, which is converted to EPA and DHA. Lastly, it ends with supplementation as a final resort, mentioning that this should not be used as a replacement for a healthy diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids from whole foods.",Response B,"Response B provides more details & background information in accordance with accepted standards of dietitians. ",Response A,"I prefer response A because it mentions the meals should ""include high-fiber foods, lean protein, and healthy fats, while minimizing refined carbs and sugars"" so the client knows how to balance meals outside of the specific recommendations. The smoothie example also includes chia seeds, which will help manage blood sugar levels more than the smoothie example in response B. I do like that response B says to consult a registered dietitian. ",Response B,"I'd say response B provides more information to support the individual's long-term goals, as the last paragraph goes into more detail about meal timing, and recommends consulting with an RD, who will work with them meet their goals. ",Response A,"I suppose response A is more broad, however they both go into detail in different areas. ",Response A,"Response A gives the client a more well-rounded overview of what to look for and which foods to choose, as well as tips for simplifying meal prep. ",Response A,"Response B gives a good example of a day's meals, however doesn't give the individual the information to work with outside of those recommendations. ",Response A,"Response A is more thoroughly tailored to the individual because it looks at the whole picture, rather than just an example meal plan. ",Response B,"Response B, because it starts with an overview of the Mediterranean diet principles & food groups, then goes on to provide specific recommendations for targeting weight loss, then for sarcopenia. ",Response B,"Response B, because it provides specific recommendations for what foods to incorporate, and then the reason. For example, ""To target sarcopenia, make sure to include plenty of high-quality proteins in your meals such as fish, chicken, legumes, and nuts.

",Response A,"Response A provides all the information & potential health implications, allowing the individual to decide for themselves whether a ketogenic diet is worth exploring. ",Response B,"I would say response B is better overall because it includes more details and explanations rather than generalizations such as ""supports overall health."" However, response A may be better to present to clients who want a more boiled down answer that highlights only what they need to know without including extra details that might make the overall message harder to remember. ",Response A,"Response B is more specific in regards to nutritional and health details, for example by explaining why we should be concerned about mercury in tuna and stating ""support muscle building, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function"" rather than ""support overall health."" However, response B only mentions omega-3s and protein as health benefits, whereas response A mentions vitamin D and selenium as well. ",Response B,"Response B offers more context regarding the nutritional components & health benefits by providing specific nutritional details (""These nutrients support muscle building, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function,"" ""extra virgin olive oil, known for its monounsaturated fats,"" ""antioxidants, which can protect cells from oxidative damage,"" etc.), whereas response A provides the answers without giving much education on the reasoning. ",Response B,"Response B is somewhat more specific & detailed, & provides more in-depth nutrition information such as ""quinoa is rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, such as magnesium, iron, and B vitamins.""",Response B,"Response B provides more information on the nutrition composition of quinoa.

",Response B,"Response B is clearer to read for a client, starting off with a list of whole grains to incorporate more of, then going on to provide meals ideas and substitution recommendations. ",Response B,"Response B, because it concludes with a reminder why it's important to include more whole grains in your diet, by stating ""Incorporating more whole grains into your diet can provide numerous health benefits, including improved digestion, increased energy levels, and better weight management.""",Response B,"Response B, for the same reason above. ",Response A,"Response A provides more detailed information on what gluten is, who needs to avoid it, a background on celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergies, including symptoms.",Response A,"Response A delves deeper into the physiological aspects of celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergies, and described each of their differences & symptoms. ",Response A,"Response A, because it is more scientific and provides more detailed information to answer  the question. ",Response B,"Overall, I like response B better, as it is more clear and relays the information in a more organized way. It also states ""milk"" instead of ""dairy,"" which is more accurate. However, it is missing sesame, and does not advise reading the nutrition labels and communicating allergies with restaurant staff, which is important to include. ",Response A,"Response A is more factually and thoroughly tailored to the individual, as it does mention sesame, which was declared a top allergen in 2023. It also ends with ""It's important for individuals with food allergies to carefully read food labels and communicate their allergies to restaurant staff to avoid potential allergic reactions,"" which is important information for clients. ",Response A,"Response A discusses allergens more accurately, as it does mention sesame, which was declared a top allergen in 2023. However, it refers to ""dairy"" rather than ""milk"" which is less accurate. ",Response B,"Response B is more clear, provides examples of which foods to start with & why, provides an accurate list of common allergens & the signs to look out for, as well as current guidelines to introduce allergens early & in controlled amounts. It also touches on choking hazards and recommends consulting a pediatrician before introducing high-risk allergenic foods. ",Response B,"Response B, for the same reasons above. ",Response B,"I would still say response B, because it is more specific/less vague, which actually makes it easier to know what to do & what to look out for. ",Response B,"Response B is more clear, organized, and approachable for a client to read. It explains the difference between heme iron and non-heme iron, recommends pairing plant-based iron sources with a source of vitamin C & gives examples, & discusses foods that can inhibit iron absorption. ",Response B,"Response B, because it discusses what to include more of, what to pair with iron-rich foods, and what to avoid while consuming iron-rich foods. ",Response B,"Response B, because it provides the explanations for its recommendations, rather than only example meals to eat, without much more information outside of those examples. ",Response B,"Response B begins more positively, stating ""There are plenty of plant-based sources of protein..."" rather than ""Navigating a healthy diet for your 10-year-old son who doesn’t like to eat meat can be challenging...."" Response B also clearly lists out high-protein vegetarian options to incorporate more of, provides examples for how to include these ingredients in his meals, and recommends consulting a pediatrician. ",Response B,"Response B, because it is more positive and makes it clear that it's very doable to maintain a healthy diet for her son without including meat. It then provides clear information on what foods to include and how to incorporate them.",Response B,"Response B, because it is more clear for a client and provides more information. ",Response A,"I like Response A better for this scenario, because it gives a concise yet educational response to this parent to help make an informed decision. I like that it highlights that the key difference is that plant-based milks have a lower protein content, but with a well-rounded diet they can still meet their protein needs. I also like that it gives examples of plant-based protein & calcium sources to make sure to incorporate in their child's diet. ",Response B,"Response B includes more specifics as to the nutrient composition of cow's milk vs. plant-based milk. It mentions vitamin B12 & fiber, which response A does not, and it discusses the importance of each nutrient mentioned. ",Response A,"Response A provides a better educational approach for long-term success, as it highlights the key differences between cow's milk & plant-based milks, and then discusses how to incorporate plant-based milk into a healthy overall well-rounded diet.

While we as RDs might know this information already, I find B hits the major concerns while explaining and providing examples.",Response B,"Both are clear and understandable. But to a lay person, being told they need to limit potassium could be confusing. Where is potassium found? Then being prompted to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables could also pose problems, as those foods tend to be the best sources of potassium. Or at least the most commonly known.",Response B,"I believe B is a great example of dietary recommendations given by RDs for CKD. The writing and organization appeared to prioritize in a specific order: Protein, sodium, electrolytes, and then fluids. Which from a clinical RD position, we tend to provide general educations.

",Response A,"I think response A was more direct talking about honey for someone who was wondering if they for example should use honey instead of sugar in their tea or if the person was dx with DM and asking about artificial sweeteners. I thought response A was more accurate because they are targeted towards individuals with DM or weight management. There needs to be more research done. As a dietitian you need to remain unbiased. So currently sweeteners are considered safe but research is saying there could be some negative effects. This is what I explain to patients currently. I say right now it is considered safe within moderation. ",Response B,"I think response B was better at being direct and answering the question based on hopefully research. But again do not love either option. I think option B was more direct and cited research. ",Response B,"This is hard I thought response A did a better job on artificial sweeteners but response B did a better job with honey because I am pretty sure honey or any type of sugar can spike blood sugar it doesn't matter the type.  So I chose response B but I am not a large fan of either response. I chose option B because I think it is important to talk about moderation in honey since I do not know the background of the patient we are speaking to. ",Response B,"I think response B provided more detail and it is important to connect with people that carbohydrates provide energy to the body. Especially since keto diet is a thing, people get confused also important that it goes over what foods contain CHO. ",Response B,"Response B talks about balance while option A talked about preference and individual needs. ",Response B,"Response A talks about simple compared to complex CHO however response B includes this and mentions if you have more simple carbohydrates or do not monitor your fat intake this can lead to CVD. ",Response B,"I think it is important both sound very similar but the wording between consider in response B compared to start your day with in response A can make an impact on a patient. Sometimes they will think that's the patients only option. ",Response B,"Response B combines culture, weight maintenance, vegetarian diet, and eating peanut allergy. Both responses , depending on the portion size may not meet 2,500kcal daily. But response B adds words like generous portion to tell the patient they need a good serving size of rice instead of just saying the food items. ",Response B,"Option B also combines more of the patients culture and desire to maintain their weight to get more calories in their day. For example, response A says to add side of toast compared to response B is more thoughtful and is okay to recommend having rice at breakfast time. ",Response B,"It actually answers the question. Response A in my opinion didn't answer the question. It basically went into carbohydrates and then said to talk to a professional to answer the question. Response B which not a lot of people know is that it is very important to plan when being a vegan or vegetarian to make sure you are getting complete protein sources. Option B was by far the better answer. ",Response B,"Long term success B. Because vegans are good at getting carbohydrates in their diet typically. They are unaware that they need to pay attention to their bone health, omega-3, hydration, and the amount of protein they need in a day. ",Response B,"I am not sure how response A addresses the question besides added foods high in protein that are considered vegan. In response B, it provided a holistic answer including the importance of prep. ",Response B,"I believe response B was more accurate not 100% sure if alcohol and coffee directly affect athletic performance. I did however like the end of response B where it talked about fast food ect. effecting athletic performance. So reposes A was more general and then speak to your provider. ",Response B,"The first thing I thought of when I read this question was to avoid alcohol. I think it is very important part since typically 25 year old males may consume alcohol and this needs to be discussed. Both responses mentioned protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. However I am not sure where I learned in school is totally accurate. I know great athletes who drink alcohol. I believe it needs to specify the amount. Because coffee should not correlate to athletic performance but it does say limit which is recommended as a healthy lifestyle. ",Response B,"I think knowing the difference between a healthy and non-healthy fat is important lifelong. And then at the end giving big picture of you can still live but in general follow a healthy lifestyle is perfect way of talking about sports. ",Response B,"I think that the second opinion is more realistic for a 20 year old college student to follow. It focuses on overall goals of keeping full, energized, supporting your brain/muscles, and on the go. compared to a more generic response in response A. ",Response B,"Response B helps a college student who has no little time at baseline understand what is important from a nutritional standpoint quickly and conveys the more important information. ",Response B,"Response A gives a generic whole grains are good for you, protein is good, fruits, and vegetables are good. I will agree it is important to mention dairy since your bones develop but knowing the importance of snacking is also very important. ",Response B,"More information in this case is good because most patients want a "" here's what you eat answer"". Response A was a clear eat oats, eat salad, and eat a stir fry and eat popcorn ect. However Response B talks about reading food labels and how nutrition isn't cookie cutter. ",Response B,"Again mentioning food labels is the most important thing to mention. Its more important to teach people how to have a healthy nutritional lifestyle compared to having a strict here is what you should eat at each meal. ",Response B,"Giving clear answers with patients rarely works because if you generalize they will try and do exactly what you say instead of thinking for themselves. They may eat a salad for lunch when they love soup. You can talk to a patient how to get a low sodium low fat soup options. Especially a homemade soup. ",Response A,"This is basically because we should recommend getting omega-3 through food but most of my patients would read this and not know what to take away from that paragraph. ",Response B,"I think it is easier to understand option B. I try to make my replies and documents at a 6th grade reading level for my patients. ",Response A,"Dietitians tend to recommend getting your omega- 3 through food instead of oral supplementation. Even though response A is more accurate, sometimes accuracy is great but means nothing if no one can understand what you are trying to convey. ",Response A,"I think response A went into more detail and know patient asked for a meal plan since response B talked about following up with a dietitian and gave a more general response to the question. ",Response B,"I think the fact the last sentence response B was important to stay hydrated and follow up with a dietitian. Because If you increase fiber you also have the increase water as well. ",Response A,"Again do not love either response but response A provides more detail and options but response B also added the importance of hydration. I thought the question was better answered in response A and felt well generalized. ",Response A,"Response B felt like they were answering each question separately instead of putting things all together and gave a meal plan. ",Response B,"It is important to mention things like staying well hydrated for kidney health, however needed a phrase if not on dialysis need to monitor protein intake. But talks about calcium and Vitamin D for bone health. ",Response A,"The A article also talks about gluten free options that also are within patient guidelines. I did like in article B it mentioned why it is important to take the ease or take strain off kidneys. In general saying snack of apple and peanut butter is good but I think it is more important to give tips like hydration instead of one example of a meal plan. ",Response B,"I think response A provided more detail to answer but not in answering the patients question while response B the first two paragraphs were almost filler and didn't really contribute to an action plan for the patient. But overall I think option B was easier to understand and did not recommend something that some dietitians are able to say ( exercise) ",Response B,"Not sure we can recommend exercise training, but I would've added talking to your physical therapist or doctor before looking into resistance training may be a better statement. But yes this is also important information. But response A since it talks about lean protein but goes into fish but also mentioned "" sugar spikes"" the patient did not ask about DM. Even though two paragraphs were fillers in response B I think it did a more accurate representation of information. ",Response B," I am not sure why response A went into inflammation, energy needs, and sugar spikes. I do not think it answered the patients question. Always important to follow up with a dietitian but I do not think parts of response A were answering the patients question. ",Response A,"Definitely response A. Response B is not a healthy way of thinking. It will NOT benefit someone with diabetes. It is very difficult to keep the body in ketosis. Diabetics need to have small amounts of CHO throughout the day to manage their blood glucose levels. I have had to explain this to many patients with DM. It is WAY more important to communicate the dangers of the ketogenic diet. ",Response A,"Response B does not convey reliable nutritional information such as "" helps with Alzheimer's"". Really the focus should be on making sure patients suffering with Alzheimer's disease EAT and eat three times daily and with a good amount of protein. ",Response A,"Most people do not know the ketogenic diet can cause nutritional deficiencies, kidney health, and mental health. Not sure where information got changed but it is concerning since avoiding carbohydrates or cutting them out is NOT a solution for controlling DM. It is having consistent CHO and good sources of CHO throughout the day. ",Response A,"I think response A sounds more coherent and highlighted all of the reasons tuna packets could impact an individual from a nutritional standpoint. ",Response A,"I think that the Response B is more detail but Response A is more generalized.  Sometimes though detail doesn't mean bad. Yes you can have an allergy to tuna but that could be for any food, someone could have an allergy to this. ",Response B,"response A says that individuals who are pregnant are ""more sensitive"" to that effect and response B talks about how it is an immune response. ",Response A,"The response B contained too much information and restated the same things. ",Response B,"Response B goes into vitamins it contains and more about what dishes it can be used in. ",Response A,"Seems more personalized and sometimes it is important to know ALOT of my patients when I go into detail about vitamins and specific nutrition zone out. They care about how does what I am saying apply to them. ",Response A,"I think response A was better because the patient did not ask why it was important to eat whole grain they are already motivated to change so they do not need to know why it helps more so as more information on which foods they could eat that contain whole grains. I usually ask what the patient eats before responding so we can talk about specifics but generically, I think response A answers the individuals question better even thought response A is easier to read. ",Response A,"I think it was important and factual that reading food labels about the first ingredient being whole grains is very factual in response A because I have been with patients who purchase honey wheat bread but the first ingredient is corn syrup. ",Response B,"response  B at the end listed all of the benefits of adapting whole grains all in the last paragraph response A was very generic and mentioned glycemic index briefly. ",Response A,"I think the first article does a better job at explaining the only people who need to avoid gluten are individuals with celiac disease OR wheat allergy. The second article ( B) left the door open with gluten sensitivities to avoid all forms of gluten together. I have had multiple patients avoid gluten fully because a doctor said "" maybe you are sensitive to gluten you may need to avoid these food groups."" ",Response A,"Similar to my last response but article A goes into the seriousness of celiac disease and cross contamination. Also the importance of mentioning anaphylaxis is important. This would be life threatening instead of sometimes general like swelling.  Mentioning the swelling is in the throat is important. ",Response A,"I think both articles do a decent job at expressing knowledge and information. However I prefer information presented for certain patient populations. Making it clear that individuals with an allergy is DIFFERENT than those with a sensitively is what I look for when discussing celiac disease. ",Response B,"I think the most important line that needs to be said is to read food labels. Response A gave the individual an option to look at common allergies and is being proactive on how to prevent anaphylaxis. Even thought response B talks about preventing exposure, it doesn't give a solution like knowing how to read the ingredients on a food label.  However response B does stress the importance of knowing about anaphylaxis both say how to treat. ",Response B,"I think knowing you can have an allergic reaction is worse than saying you need to look at the ingredients on a food label. If you say awareness and management, this infers to the fact patients need to be aware WHAT they are eating. ",Response B,"Responce B is more clear with what the 8 allergens are instead of dairy ? I do not believe is one of the 8 allergens. ",Response B,"I think A was more clear what to look for but overall B provided better information overall. Giving more information to a new mom is good. They are more likely to read information for their child and are going to be more interested in specifics. ",Response B,"Honestly children and infants are not my specialty but I do know option B is very important to TALK to an MD before introducing new foods that a child had an allergic reaction to. ",Response A,"However article A seemed to be at a lower reading level. Something patients find helpful is having mini paragraphs that bullet point or outline important information topics. Sometimes simple though can be deceiving. ",Response B,"I think the second response sounds good because it doesn't give a meal plan, it gives you actual tools and ideas to help increase your iron. For example, talks about what an inhibit the absorption of iron. ",Response B,"The question was not to provide a meal plan, it was more of where do I start to add more sources of iron in my lifestyle. It also explains that animal proteins are better absorbed than plant sources. ",Response B,"The importance of knowing vitamin C paired with iron can increase the absorption is important. It is accurate to tell a patient to drink OJ, but explaining the why is also just as important. Especially since the person may not even have OJ as a part of their lifestyle, culture, food preference, or daily intake. ",Response B,"I think that response B was more important because it mentioned the importance of growth. This is not my specialty but I do know that growth in adolescence is very important (growth charts ect). I have a few children in the past we have been stunted due to inadequate nutrition. I do like the first sentence in response A better because it acknowledges the difficulty of the question. But response B also seems more detailed.  ",Response A,"I think response B goes into more about how the patient should follow a more plant based diet compared to response A that says to start out with other sources of protein first. ",Response B,"Response B provided more reasoning and ideas but mostly to follow up with care. Response A I think it stated better however if the mother misreads something or doesn't know how to get all essential amino acids in a plant based diet, the 10 year old could be lacking certain nutrients. ",Response B,"Response B gives a whole rounded answer. Especially explaining cows milk provides different nutrition initially is helpful. Response A says oat milk is the same nutrition as cows milk which is not factual. ",Response B,"Saying that different types of plant based milk and cows milk has different nutritional needs, similar to how each person needs different needs based on their medical condition and/or how cows milk may be a good or bad choice for some people. ",Response B,"The end of response B talks about the importance of a balance diet and how cows milk helps supports a person with brain function, Even when mentioning pea protein, it is not providing the exact same nutrition but has more protein than oat milk.

All of this is important with the decision in starting intermittent fasting ",Response B,"Response B discusses how weight loss is more than just the timing of eating, but also the importance of lifestyle, diet, and exercise. People often believe the diet itself is the answer, when it is actually the overall picture. Response B does a better job discussing that, and that is something that is always discussed among dietitians ",Response B,"this individual was wondering about fruit specifically, and although ultimately the overall picture does need to be considered, with this specific question it was more appropriate to explain why fruit is still good with diabetes. ",Response B,"Response A just states to eat the low sugar fruits, while response B explains the benefits of these lower glycemic fruits. Providing an explanation helps significantly with comprehension ",Response B,"this individual was wondering about fruits, and response B provides greater detail as to why the fruits are still important in a diabetes diet while also being mindful of the amount consumed. ",Response A,"Response A overall gives better information that allows the reader to make a more informed decision. ",Response A,"There is not really a right answer for this question because it really just depends on the individuals goals/preferences.

",Response B,"The sentence ""In essence, carbohydrates themselves are not inherently harmful, but the source and quantity significantly influence their impact on health"" is what makes the overall better response.

I don't feel response B articulates enough as to why these recommendations are necessary to help the individual meet their goals. ",Response A,"Response B is just a little too general, while response A states to eat carbs to provide energy for workouts and eat protein at each meal after intense workouts. These few specifications make it more clear that the target audience is an athlete, and not just general information ",Response A,"Response A just provides more reasoning as to why this recommendations are essential for this individual ",Response A,"Response A goes into more detail about why these foods/nutrients are important for this individual at this stage of life. ",Response B,"This response uses very basic terminology, that most individuals can understand.

People need to know why the examples provided help meet their needs. ",Response B,"Something that really stood out with this response that makes it even better for this individual is discussing using the precooked, canned foods. The individual said they didn't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, and this is huge with preparing stuff ahead of time. ",Response B,"I just don't feel that response A really gives any education. Just ""eat this"" with no real reason as to why.

",Response B,"response B does a good job stating what is needed at each meal with examples, while not over explaining. it discusses the ideal eating schedule as well without going into too much detail. with response B, it feels like the individual knows what they need, but also is not being over explained/overly strict of a meal plan like response A may provide.",Response A,"this provides specific recommendations for each of this individuals concerns while response B just gives example meals with no real explanations. protein powder is also not generally recommended with kidney disease making one of the suggestions inappropriate for this individual ",Response B,"this response gives actual examples of meals which is what the individual requested ",Response A,"although does not give specific Meal recommendations, this gives better overall thorough information that will better their health with the questions the individual had. it provides examples of foods to make with easy ways to prepare these foods",Response A,"response A starts with explaining why foods In the Mediterranean diet help met the individuals goals, and then goes into detail about which foods to incorporate more of",Response B,"eating an adequate amount of protein, while also doing exercises to increase muscle mass is how one improves sarcopenia, while cutting back portions/incorporating more nutrient dense foods leads to weight loss. response b has this information clearly stated in its response",Response B,"this response directly explains why the foods in the Mediterranean diet ",Response B,"It is always best to have both the positive and negative affects of the diets given to individuals. there is never one right answer with nutrition, and if not given the whole picture, a person cannot make the right decision for themselves.

",Response B,"Response B goes into more detail and provides more ways on how to use it in a gluten free diet. ",Response A,"Response A has the same information, but is more clear and to the point. There is extra fluff in response B that is informative, but can get in the way of the understanding as to why quinoa is a good option. ",Response B,"Response B provides the same information, but does so in laymen's terms making it much easier to understand. It also provides specific example meals, but just swaps like response A does. ",Response A,"This response provides more examples of whole grains, which ultimately is the question being asked. ",Response B,"This response has an entire paragraph discussing the health benefits of fiber rich foods that are not mentioned in response A. Response A just says these whole grains can help you reap the benefits of fiber, but doesn't discuss what those benefits are",Response B,"this is just more clear and concise for the general public's understanding ",Response A,"Both responses provide accurate information, however, Response A just goes into more detail about the different reactions someone may experience and the reason for that. ",Response A,"the big difference is that response A mentions the need to check the labels for cross-contamination/hidden gluten. Cross contamination often gets forgotten about, and it Is really important for individuals with allergies to know if the foods they are eating are processed in the same factory as their allergen in order to avoid reactions. ",Response A,"response A provides examples of each of the allergens, while also stating the importance of reading the labels/communicating your allergen as it has not provided an all encompassing list. ",Response A,"wheat is not the same as gluten as indicated in response B, which can be very misleading and cause an individual to stop eating rye/barley as it contains gluten but not wheat",Response A,"it comes down to reading the label because these allergens are not always obvious to the consumer ",Response B,"This response provides safety hazards to consider, which although seems obvious, is still important to mention. ",Response B,"Babies can start with age appropriate meats right away as it is a great way for babies to get protein and iron. ",Response A,"Response A provides the same information with fewer words, which often helps with understanding. ",Response B,"I like the set up of this response better. Response A feels jumbled with the information, while response B flows better and helps with better understanding. 
While response A does discuss proper sources of iron, response B discusses they different types of iron, and how to maximize the absorption from this nonheme iron. ",Response A," This response provides meal and snack examples to add iron with tips on how to increase iron absorption. It answers the question asked while providing education. ",Response B,"Discussing the cookware, sources of iron, and nutrients that enhance/inhibit absorption is all accurate and what is recommended to improve anemia ",Response A,"Response A just provides more direct recommendations and examples to increase protein intake. I like that it also gives swaps for the foods they enjoy already (i.e switching to high protein pasta). Eggs are often forgotten to be a good source of protein, and I like that it mentions this food as well. ",Response A,"Response A just gives better examples in my opinions of foods that are commonly eaten among 10 year olds and how to make them high in protein without the meat. ",Response A,"This response provided more specific swaps in the diet to increase the protein intake (using bean burgers, lentil tacos, chickpea pasta, etc.) ",Response B,"this provides more detail of each milk alternative and allows the reader to make a better choice based on their child's need. It's just more clear as to what benefits the milk alternatives contain and why this may or may not be the right choice based on the child's current diet. ",Response B,"response B compares the milk alternatives' nutritional components to cows milk rather than just stating it can be an alternative to cow's milk like it does in response A ",Response B,"with response A, it comes across that all milk alternatives are fortified with these nutrients which is not always the case. with the use of ""fortified versions"" in response B, it indicates the reader does need to look at the labels and be sure they are getting the right version of the product for their child.

The problem with this is that they tend to have a limited perspective because those are the only examples they have and they tend to use them and then get tired of eating it and steer away from the meal plan principles ",Response A,It gives reasons behind why you’re doing it and not just examples of me,Response A,All the reason stated above,Response B,I feel like response b better targets each thing that is helpful for both weight management sarcopinia,Response B,"Response b directly correlates the dietary advice to the individuals concerns and again uses the terminology, mindful",Response B,See above,Response A,This response directly answers the question that was asked of long-term effects,Response A,Response a directly answers the question and defines it in simple terms with long-term effects are as opposed to response be which list positive and negatives to the keto diet.,Response A,"Response to a directly states facts, which I think is a better approach",Response B,"I believe both responses give clear information about the properties of the tuneup, but be explains the negative effects a little bit better",Response B,Be is the more generalized response,Response B,I think response be definitely spells it out a little clearer and gives more information to support,Response B,"I feel like it gives more specifics about the benefits of quinoa, and also how to use it",Response B,"It speaks to the essential nutrients and getting protein, especially on vegetarian or vegan diets",Response B,"See above ",Response B,It takes them more positive approach and gives specific examples,Response B,Response gives much better examples and support those examples with every day useful tips,Response B,Endless ways that following whole-grain diet will benefit the patient such as weight management and increased energy levels,Response B,It is more concise,Response A,"I don’t know if I would say it is More accurate, I think both responses are accurate. I just think a includes a little bit more specific about the actual allergy.",Response A,I think response is just a little bit easier for the average patient to digest,Response B,"Although response a directly answers the question, response B outcomes of consuming these foods if individual are allergic to it",Response A,"Response is definitely more direct and just list the food, which is what the question asked.",Response B,Response B I believe is the better response seeing as it does give outcomes as well as examples,Response A,I feel like this gives more of the answer behind while you’re doing things and some better examples,Response A,It just gives more facts about the allergens and not just a list of foods to try,Response A,It’s more to the point and just read easier,Response A,The information is laid out in an easier format to interpret and understand it has both facts and examples,Response B,B gives a little bit more specific examples like the 70% chocolate,Response B,B uses the word mindful which I think is a word that is very current that people can respond to,Response B,"it gives the definition of plant-based proteins and proteins from dairy products in a brief, concise fashion with specific ex",Response B,it gives more specific examples of how to add these,Response B,it is a better overall response that gives the why behind what the parents need to do to help the 10-year-old,Response B,"The first response list all necessary information, but I think it doesn’t read as well as the second response. Does they both give some good information but I think the second responses easier to understand.",Response A,Response is definitely just more factual,Response B,Response B gives better tools for the patient to make their own decisions,25

Also focuses on weight management and overall health which are crucial for T2DM management,Response A,"Did a better job explaining meal timing, portion control, and hydration in addition to tips on carbs/protein intakes",Response B,"Response A doesn't give much practical information for someone new to CKD to follow. Doesn't explain what foods have Na+, K+, or phos which is typically confusing for people",Response B,"Talks though nutrients one at a time and gives dietary explanations of each. ",Response B,"gives specifics of Na+ restrictions, which is true for patients with all stages of CKD. Encourages meeting with a nephrologist and a renal dietitian to determine dietary goals for other nutrients. ",Response A,more clear explanation between risks and benefits of the diet,Response A,"Response B seems to focus more on what intermittent fasting is, which is not the question posed. Response A focuses more clearly on the risks/benefits in regard to weight management as asked",Response B,"I dislike the phrasing "" intermittent fasting may improve metabolism by promoting fat burning"" in response A. If the person enters ketosis as a result of fasting, this is not an ""improved"" state of metabolism, it is just a different state of metabolism. A RD would also encourage hydration, exercise, and encourage a healthful lifestyle",Response B,"Liked that it talked about the fiber content in fruit as well as just the sugar.

Response A felt kind of vague. ",Response B,More specifics on the health benefits of carbs of risks of excess refined carbs,Response B,Gave good examples of complex and refined carbs and their benefits/risks.,Response B,"Response A was not nearly as specific to Filipino cuisine ",Response B,"Response A appeared to take the person's phrasing of ""manage my weight"" and assumed weight loss. Not many calorically dense foods, the meal plan recommended likely wouldn't meet their caloric needs to maintain weight",Response B,"included allergens, healthful fats to increase kcal intakes, and specific Filipino cuisine examples",Response B,"Response B goes beyond just macronutrients. Also contains micronutrients and hydration. ",Response B,"More depth to the answer, explained clearly with examples.",Response A,"Protein recommendations in Response B are too high. ",Response A,"While Response A reads more smoothly than response B, response B includes more specific examples for the reader to use. ",Response B,"Includes plant-based proteins under the protein section, includes information on caffeine and alcohol which often athletes don't consider, and need for sports drinks (which contain sodium). Response A tells the athlete to limit sodium which is not helpful for an athlete's rehydration",Response B,Response B gives a lot of specific ideas that the reader can implement into their lifestyle. RDs encourage patients to start with just a few changes and build upon them so this gives the more specifics on how to do so vs the more generalize recommendations in response A,Response B,"Both responses do well explaining need for food variety, response B includes snack ideas which is helpful.

",Response A,"I really liked that it started out telling them that dietary changes are manageable despite their busy schedule. Gave some specific examples but also some information about nutrients to include so they can go beyond the examples given. ",Response B,"Much less specific information regarding nutrients. Focused more on carbohydrates as a group vs talking about fiber and refined carbs. ",Response B,"While I thought Response A did better explaining ways to simplify meal prep (batch cooking), examples were contradictory. 1 example: Encouraged low phos choices but then recommended dairy for bone health which is high phos. ",Response B,"not perfect,. but more accurate in examples given",Response B,more factual information provided,Response A,Easier to read. More tailored to their mediterranean diet preferences,Response A,"both promotes discuss need for protein, food variety, and resistance exercise. I prefer response A because it also includes smaller more frequent balanced meals to prevent overeating and encouraged meeting with an RD",Response A,"answers were evidence based, met the patients asked for goals, and was tailored to their dietary preference of mediterranean diet",Response B,"touches on both positives and negatives of the diet.

Unfortunately, we are taught to cater education to an elementary school reading levels unless the patient shows you further understanding.

",Response B,First paragraph is more difficult to read in response A,Response A,better examples of how to incorporate whole grains into diet,Response A,"both answers are factual. Response A gives a lot more examples however response B does better at more thoroughly explaining some potential health benefits of more whole grain in diet. The individual didn't ask for why whole grains are beneficial, so Response A is better. ",Response B,Gave more information about the health benefits of whole grains. Response A is vary vague with this.,Response A,"More thorough explanation of what gluten is, role in foods, and conditions in which it may need to be avoided. I liked that it also included information about cross contamination. ",Response A,Response B doesn't talk about damage to the intestines that can happen with celiac disease,Response A,"encouraged adherence to a strict gluten-free diet to manage symptoms and maintain health. Encouraged being aware of risk of cross contamination. ",Response A,"Emphasizes need to look at labels and communicate with other people preparing your food about the allergies. ",Response A,"In 2021, the FDA added a 9th major food allergen to the formerly known ""big 8."" Response B doesn't include sesame. I do wish response A used the word milk when listing the allergen and phrased the milk allergens differently such as ""Milk allergies can be triggered by consuming dairy such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream.""",Response A,"Gives examples and emphasizes need to check label as the examples they gave are not all-encompassing
",Response B,Response A felt very non-specific when reading.

",Response B,Most people need specifics. Response A assumes parents know what reactions to watch for and doesn't encourage including common allergens in diets. Some parents may just avoid all together out of fear of reaction,Response B,"While response A has a few more iron rich food examples, it feels limiting telling the patient what foods have to be eaten at what mealtime. Time of day these foods are included doesn't impact absorption and some patients could assume this is what it is saying. It would have been more helpful if it said ""mealtime examples could be:"" or something similar. Response B does better at explaining what foods aid in and inhibit iron absorption",Response B,"includes good examples, reads clearly, and encourages meeting with an RD to meet with their specific needs",Response B,More specific to detail about heme vs non-heme iron and when ascorbic acid needs to be included for improved absorption. Better information on foods that inhibit absorption,Response A,"factual, better information of high protein foods, more practical examples",Response A,Gave good examples of how to incorporate high protein food items into dishes a 10 year old may eat,Response A,"Response B listed broccoli and spinach as high protein, which is inaccurate",Response B,More clearly explained comparison to the milks.
